                            "value": "This thesis links two realms of particle accelerator dynamics and precision particle physics. The achievement of precise luminosity measurement at hadron colliders is enabled with dedicated luminometers. For the Run 3 period, the luminometer upgrade was planned for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The intricacies of the process of preparation, installation, and commissioning of the upgraded Fast Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM1F-\\utca) are described in this thesis. Its design was optimized based on analysis of the performance of the Run 2 version of BCM1F with the main changes being the utilization of silicon sensors and real-time and dead-time free pulse shape analysis in the back-end electronics. The BCM1F-utca optimization and resulting performance are studied in detail. The most common and most precise way of obtaining the absolute calibration of the luminosity at the hadron colliders is the van der Meer (vdM) method. However, it requires careful consideration and correction for the accelerator-related systematic effects. While numerous particle accelerator effects have previously been studied in detail, their direct impact on the precision luminosity calibration was neglected for a long time. Notably, the historically disregarded beam-beam interaction is now recognized as a significant factor. The first correction models overestimated the optical effect induced by the beam-beam-interaction by half. This prompted an extended effort to recognize and quantify different ingredients of the beam-beam-related systematic uncertainty on the luminosity calibration. The development of the new correction model has started, originally aiming to parametrize the beam-beam effects on luminosity in the simplest case of a single interaction point. The main objective was to provide per-bunch corrections based on its properties. This study aimed to extend the correction model with a further level of complexity - multi-collision effects. The investigation into additional contributions to the systematic uncertainty arising from beam-beam interaction is presented, considering the crossing-angles in the vdM scans as well as the sensitivity to the phase advances between the collision points. The multi-particle simulation studies are complemented with a dedicated beam-beam experiment at the LHC that was designed to provide the first statistically significant measurement of the beam-beam effects on luminosity. The beam-beam effects were studied depending on the strength of the interaction, as a function of separation steps when scanning the beams, as well as depending on the number of collisions. The detailed detector studies led to a minimized integration systematic uncertainty on the BCM1F-\\utca measured integrated luminosity in 2022. The absolute luminosity scale calibration of this data set with the vdM method was performed, and the beam-beam effects were among the largest calibration corrections. The corresponding overall systematic uncertainty was estimated, profiting from the detailed studies on the beam-beam interaction effects.This work culminates in an unprecedented precision of the CMS preliminary luminosity calibration, with a projection towards achieving the ultimate precision below 1%.",

GPDs provide a novel and relatively unexplored view into the structure of nucleon and expand the knowledge given from parton distribution functions (PDF) and parton densities to a more com- plex, three-dimensional picture. While the golden channel of GPD parametri- sation is DVCS, the exclusive meson production gives access to complementary GPDs, provides information of flavour dependence of GPDs, and in case of exclusive π0 production in particular, also represents the main background pro- cess of DVCS, hence it is essential to constrain it. The theoretical formalism of GPD and HEMP description is outlined in the first part of the thesis. The mea- surement of exclusive processes represents an important part of COMPASS-II programme. The dedicated GPD programme commenced with a 4-weeks-long pilot run in 2012, followed by the main data taking in 2016-2017, using 160 GeV/c muon beams and a liquid hydrogen target, equipped with a recoil pro- ton detector. The COMPASS spectrometre and its configuration for the GPD programme is described in the second section. The exclusive processes require a perfect performance of...",

I first met Robi\nin 2017, when he gave a lecture at my university, which immediately inspired me to work\nwith him, and our early research projects truly laid the foundation of my research interest.\nEven before he became my advisor, I received so much support from him. He not only\ntaught me how to become a good researcher, but has always been there for me when I\nneeded his help. I’ve always felt grateful to have an advisor like him.\n\nI must also thank Gergely G. Barnaföldi, my ALICE group leader and research col-\nlaborator. I learned a lot from him throughout the years and wrote my very first research\narticle together with him and Robi. His optimistic attitude, encouragement and support\nhelped me to get through some of the hard times in my research career, and I truly appre-\nciate it.\n\nI am also thankful to Laura Havener, with whom I started working in the ALICE Col-\nlaboration a few years ago, and taught me a lot about data analysis. Her positive and\nencouraging personality, combined with her physics insights, had a great impact on me.\n\nLast but not least I am the most grateful to my family: my parents and two sisters, for\ntheir unwavering support and belief in me.\n\nThe research in this doctoral thesis was supported by the NKFIH grants OTKA FK131979\nand K135515, as well as by the 2019-2.1.11-TÉT-2019-00078 and 2021-4.1.2-NEMZ KI-\n2024-00034 grants, and by the Wigner Scientific Computing Laboratory (WSCLAB) and\nthe HUN-REN Wigner Cloud. Experimental contributions were facilitated by the Veszter-\ngombi High Energy Laboratory at the HUN-REN Wigner RCP.\n\n\n\nContents\n\nList of Figures 5\n\n1 Introduction 1\n\n2 High-energy Hadron

This matter was dominated by\nquarks and gluons that are subject to the strong force. Under usual circumstances, quarks\nare confined into hadrons. However, at extreme temperatures and densities, quarks and\ngluons can enter a deconfined state, forming the so-called quark-gluon plasma (QGP).\n\nTo recreate the extreme conditions of matter which existed in the very early universe,\nwe use powerful accelerators to make collisions between protons or heavy-ions, such as\ngold or lead nuclei. In the heavy-ion collisions hundreds of protons and neutrons in two\nsuch nuclei collide into each other to form a minuscule fireball in which everything melts\ninto the quark-gluon plasma. The fireball then starts cooling and the individual quarks and\ngluons (collectively called partons) recombine into ordinary matter that flies away in all\ndirections until they end up in our detectors. The final state of the collision contains many\nspecies of particles such as pions and kaons, which are mesons consisting of a quark-\nantiquark pair; or protons and neutrons, which are baryons containing three quarks; and\neven antiprotons and antineutrons, which may combine to form the nuclei of antiatoms as\nheavy as helium.\n\nEven though heavy-ion collisions are only on the femtoscale, in high-energy physics\nthey are often referred to as large systems, because the volume of the system created in\nthe collision is large enough for the quark-gluon plasma to form. In contrast, we call the\nsystem of colliding protons (or antiprotons) small system. In proton–proton collisions,\nno nuclear effects are present, therefore they serve as a baseline for heavy-ion collisions,\nwhile proton–heavy ion collisions are investigated to learn about cold nuclear matter ef-\nfects. Recently, however, collisions of small systems with high final-state multiplicity\nbecame a focus of intensive investigation. With the advent of the Large Hadron Col-\nlider (LHC), features have been observed that had been associated with the presence of\nquark-gluon plasma, even though QGP is not expected to be formed in small systems in\na significant volume. These observations include collectivity effects such as long-range\n\n1\n\n\n\nChapter 1 – Introduction\n\nnear-side correlations and the asymmetry in the azimuthal distribution of final state parti-\ncles, also called anisotropic flow. A possible explanation is that quark-gluon plasma can be\ncreated in a small volume in a fraction of collisions of small systems. There are, however,\nalternative explanations of these observed phenomena that do not assume the quark-gluon\nplasma. Semi-soft vacuum-QCD effects such as multiple-parton interactions are shown to\nproduce signatures of collectivity. The aim of this thesis is to study heavy and light-flavor\njet fragmentation and hadronization properties in high-energy proton–proton collisions to\nshed light on the particle production mechanisms that lead to collective-like behavior in\nsmall systems.\n\nOne of the main research areas is the study of jets. I characterized differential and in-\ntegral jet shapes to look for modifications caused by non-trivial quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD) effects. I also investigated the multiplicity distributions (number of charged final\nstate particles) as a function of the jet transverse momentum. Recent results show that the\nmultiplicity distributions follow a scaling similar to the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scal-\ning, which provides important lessons on jet fragmentation. In my studies, I searched for\nthe KNO-like scaling in simulations for heavy-flavor jets, and I also carried out the first\nmeasurement of jet-momentum-dependent jet multiplicity distributions with the ALICE\nexperiment.\n\nAnother major topic in my thesis, connected to jet fragmentation, concerns the un-\nderstanding of heavy-flavor hadroproduction in proton–proton collisions at LHC energies.\nThe production cross section of hadrons can be calculated using the factorization theorem,\nwhich usually assumes that the fragmentation functions are universal across different col-\nlision systems. Experimental results such as the enhanced production of charm baryons\nquestion this assumption. I used a model with color reconnection beyond leading color ap-\nproximation (CR-BLC) to seek explanation for the charm-baryon enhancement, and pro-\nposed new observables for future measurements. I characterized the collision events using\ndifferent event-activity classifiers, that allow for investigating the connections between the\nleading QCD processes and the underlying event.\n\nThe primary motivation driving my research is to explore the boundary between hard\nand soft processes occurring in proton–proton collisions, which is a significant yet rela-\ntively unexplored area. Keeping these overarching objectives in mind, the thesis is struc-\ntured as follows.\n\nIn Chapter 2 the theoretical background for the study of high-energy hadron collisions\nis laid out to serve as a basis for understanding the results presented in this thesis. I\nstart with detailing the most important properties of the strong interaction, one of the four\nfundamental interactions of Nature, which is also the most relevant interaction in our case.\nAfter a brief discussion of the phase diagram of the strong interaction and its implications,\nwe are going to turn our attention to the experimental observables that we can measure.\nMany of these observables are related to collimated sprays of hadrons, called jets. A\nsection is dedicated to the properties and experimental signatures of the QGP. Following\n\n2\n\n\n\nChapter 1 – Introduction\n\nthat I discuss the role of heavy-flavor in the analysis of hadron collisions and discuss the\nevent classifiers. To conclude this chapter, I will cover the relevant experimental facilities,\ndetailing the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the ALICE apparatus.\n\nIn Chapter 3 we dive into the study of jet shapes and their multiplicity dependence by\nmeasuring the differential and integral jet shapes as a function of the event multiplicity.\nMy main goal is to show that multiplicity differential jet shape observables are experimen-\ntally accessible using data from the LHC Run 3 data taking period, and to motivate such\nmeasurements. Not only can we observe a multiplicity dependence, but a characteristic\njet size was also found, which is a certain transverse-momentum-dependent radius of the\nreconstructed jets for which the transverse momentum density is independent of the event\nmultiplicity regardless of the choice of physics models and jet reconstruction algorithms.\nFinally, I introduce a double ratio of the multiplicity dependent jet shapes, to observe this\ndependence while minimizing the biases in this measurement.\n\nThe scaling properties of jets, which are closely connected to the subject of multiplic-\nity dependence, are discussed in Chapter 4. Motivated by the recently revealed KNO-\nlike scaling inside the jets, which indicates that the KNO scaling is violated by complex\nvacuum-QCD processes outside the jet development, I investigated the flavor-dependence\nof this scaling. I demonstrated that using heavy-flavor, the origin of scaling can be pinned\nto the partonic level. These studies motivate experimental verification that can be carried\nout using the ALICE detector.\n\nIn Chapter 5 I present an ongoing measurement of the multiplicity distributions as a\nfunction of the jet momentum, that will allow for the experimental verification of KNO-\nlike scaling within jets. This was motivated by the phenomenological studies discussed in\nthe previous chapter. The technical steps of the analysis such as the evaluation of correc-\ntions for detector efficiency and momentum smearing are also presented.\n\nIn Chapter 6 I discuss the measurement of azimuthal correlations of heavy-flavor decay\nelectrons in ALICE data. I participated in this analysis mainly by performing detailed\nMonte-Carlo simulations which serve as input for the corrections in the measurement and\nthe interpretation of the data. Experimental data are compared to the simulation results in\nproton–proton and proton–lead collisions at a center-of-mass energy of\n\n√\ns = 5.02 TeV.\n\nChapter 7 is devoted to my studies on the charm baryon enhancement, one of the hot\nresearch topics in recent years. Experimental results coming from multiple LHC experi-\nments imply that the commonly assumed universality of the fragmentation functions (i.e.\ncollision system independence) does not hold, and a so-far not completely explained charm\nbaryon enhancement is observed in proton–proton collisions. Several models aim at ex-\nplaining these results. I use a model with color reconnection beyond leading color approx-\nimation (CR-BLC) to investigate the expected details of the charm-baryon enhancement\nand to propose new methods of measurements.\n\nFinally, in Chapter 8 I summarize the results and the main conclusions presented in\nthis thesis and provide an outlook for future research.\n\n3\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nHigh-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nIn this chapter I present the theoretical background of high-energy hadron collisions,\nwhich is necessary to understand the results presented in this thesis. I introduce the Stan-\ndard Model (SM) of particle physics in Sec. 2.1, which is the theory that provides the\nbest description of fundamental particles and their interactions. In Sec. 2.2 I discuss the\nquantum field theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in detail.\nSimulating hadron collision events to test QCD predictions is so complex that it requires us\nto utilize Monte Carlo event generators. After describing these event generators in Sec. 2.3,\nI turn to one of the most important experimental consequences of theory in Sec. 2.4: the\ncollimated streams of particles created from a hard scattering process, known as jets. This\nsection covers the reconstruction of jets and the jet shape observables that we can mea-\nsure. Another important consequence of QCD is the existence of the extremely hot and\ndense matter, the quark-gluon plasma, which is discussed in Sec. 2.5, including its most\nimportant properties and experimental signatures. The focus of this thesis is heavy-flavor\nmeasurements, I present some of the most important heavy-flavor results in Sec. 2.6. The\nunderlying event affects measurements, therefore I discuss the subject in Sec. 2.7, includ-\ning the technical details of the event classifiers that I utilize throughout this thesis. Finally,\nI close the chapter with Sec. 2.8 by describing the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and\nthe technical details of the ALICE detector.\n\n2.1 The Standard Model\nIn the Universe there are four known fundamental interactions: the electromagnetic, the\nweak and the strong forces, and gravity. At high-enough energy scales the electromagnetic\nand weak interactions can be unified into the electroweak interaction, but so far it is an\nopen problem to unify all the interactions.\n\nThe Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics describes three of the known\nfundamental interactions except for gravity (which is neglected in the analysis of hadron\n\n4\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\ncollisions due to its weakness compared to the other forces), and classifies the elementary\nparticles similarly to the periodic table of the elements. These elementary particles are\ncategorized by their spin in two groups: in the units of the reduced Planck constant ~,\nthe bosons have spin in integer values, while the fermions have half-odd-integer values.\nAccording to the spin-statistics theorem, the spin dictates the kind of quantum statistics\nthe particles follow. The quantum-mechanical wave function of a boson is symmetric\nunder particle exchange, while the fermion wave function is anti-symmetric and they obey\nPauli’s exclusion principle. The former particles follow Bose-Einstein statistics, the latter\nfollow Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n\nFigure 2.1: The elementary particles of the Standard Model.\n\nThe elementary fermions are the 6 quarks and 6 leptons. The leptons themselves con-\nsist of the electron, muon and tau particles, and their associated neutrinos. Furthermore,\nboth quarks and leptons can be divided into 3 generations, where each generation has\na quark pair and lepton pair (see Fig. 2.1, taken from [1]). The generations reflect the\nchronology of their discoveries. It is important to note that all fermions have an antipar-\nticle. Quarks form colorless bound states called hadrons, which can be mesons (quark-\nantiquark pairs), baryons (three quarks) or antibaryons (three antiquarks).\n\nThe elementary bosons are categorized into vector (or gauge) bosons with spin 1, and\na scalar boson with spin 0. The gauge bosons are associated with the fundamental inter-\nactions as their force carrier particles: the photon (γ) with the electromagnetic interaction,\nthe 8 gluons (g) with the strong interaction, and the W± and Z0 bosons with the weak\ninteraction. The only known elementary scalar boson is the Higgs boson (H0) which is\nthe quantum of the Higgs field that is responsible for the mass generation of the elemen-\ntary particles through the Higgs mechanism. The mechanism behind the neutrino mass\ngeneration is still an open question.\n\n5\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nThe Standard Model not only categorizes the elementary particles, but describes the\ndynamics between these fundamental constituents, i.e. how these particles interact with\neach other. Currently the best description is provided by quantum gauge theories, which\nare based on symmetry principles. More precisely, we use the Lagrangian formalism gen-\neralized for quantum fields, where the form of the Lagrangian density is dictated by its\ninvariance under local gauge transformations. The non-Abelian gauge theory describing\nthe SM is based on the SU(3)c×SU(2)L×U(1)Y symmetry, where c denotes the color de-\ngrees of freedom, ”L” is an abbreviation for ”left-handed”, and Y stands for hypercharge.\nThe SU(3)c group is the symmetry group of the strong interaction, while SU(2)L×U(1)Y\nis the symmetry group describing the electroweak interaction. Before discussing the gauge\ntheory of the strong interaction, we should recall what a quantum field theory is.\n\nIn classical point mechanics, we can use Hamilton’s principle, which states that the\ndynamics of a physical system are determined by a variational problem for the Lagrangian\nL, which is a functional containing all information of a system which is required to de-\ntermine its equations of motion. In classical field theory, we use instead the Lagrangian\ndensity L (referred to simply as Lagrangian from now on). The action functional S is then\ndefined as\n\nS[ψ(x)] =\n\n∫\nV\n\nd4xL\n(\nψ(x), ∂µψ(x)\n\n)\n, (2.1)\n\nwhich gives us the equations of motion if we solve the variational problem for the 4D\nspacetime volume. The action in this example is varied by the ψ(x) field, where x is the\nspacetime coordinate.\n\nThe Lagrangian formalism has the advantage of making the symmetries of the theory\nmore prevalent. One way to go from classical field theories to quantum field theories is to\nuse second quantization, in which the quantum Hamiltonian is assumed to take the form of\nthe classical Hamiltonian, then the Poisson relations of the classical quantities are replaced\nwith commutation relations. The resulting theory is a quantum field theory with the fields\nbecoming operator valued distributions, and unlike non-relativistic quantum mechanics, it\ncan describe both particle creation and annihilation processes.\n\nAnother way to quantize a classical field theory is to use the path integral formal-\nism, which is the commonly used approach to quantize gauge theories. A proper action\nfunctional S(φ, g,m) is first chosen, where φ denotes all fields, g denotes the coupling\nconstants, and m denotes the masses and possible extra parameters. The expectation value\nof a quantum mechanical operator is then calculated by integrating over all possible field\nconfigurations, weighted by the exponential of the action times the imaginary unit (~ = 1):\n\nO[φ] =\n\n∫\nDφO[φ]eiS[φ,g,m]∫\nDφ eiS[φ,g,m]\n\n. (2.2)\n\n6\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n2.2 The Strong Interaction\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) is one of the main pillars of the Standard Model, which\ndescribes the strong interaction that couples to color charges and is mediated by eight glu-\nons. The color charge is the QCD analog of the electric charge in electromagnetism (EM),\nbut while the symmetry of the electromagnetic interaction is connected to the Abelian Lie\ngroup U(1), the symmetry of QCD is connected to the more complex non-Abelian Lie\ngroup SU(3). A significant difference between the force carrier particles of QCD and\nEM is, that while the photons do not carry electric charge, the gluons carry color charge,\ntherefore they participate in the strong interaction and can interact with each other. This\nproperty of the strong force is closely connected to the non-Abelian symmetry of the the-\nory. As an important consequence, the gluons can form bound states with each other,\ncalled glueballs.\n\nIn the rest of this section, I briefly describe the mathematical description of quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) and summarize the most important elements of the theory. For a\nmore detailed discussion I refer to the literature [2–5].\n\n2.2.1 The QCD Lagrangian\n\nThe fundamental degrees of freedom of QCD are the fermionic quark fields ψ(x) and\nbosonic gluon fields Aaµ(x) with a = 1, ..., 8, where the gluon fields belong to the adjoint\nrepresentation of the SU(3) Lie group. The full QCD Lagrangian is given by\n\nLQCD = −1\n\n4\nF a\nµ ν F\n\naµ ν + ψ̄ (i γ µDµ −m)ψ, (2.3)\n\nconsisting the pure gauge part and the fermionic part. The quarks have six different flavors,\ntherefore the fermionic part contains six separate terms, one for each flavor. The pure\ngauge part contains the field strength tensor\n\nF a\nµ ν = ∂µA\n\na\nν − ∂ν Aaµ + g fabcAbµA\n\nc\nν , (2.4)\n\nwhere g is the coupling constant and fabc is the structure constant of the SU(3) group. The\nform of the quark-gluon interaction is given by the covariant derivative\n\nDµ = ∂µ − i g Aaµ\nλa\n\n2\n, (2.5)\n\nwhich has the form to allow comparing the fields at different points of the space-time man-\nifold by parallel transporting the fields while keeping the Lagrangian invariant under local\nphase transformations of Ψ(x). The λa/2 are the generators of SU(3) in the fundamental\nrepresentation (the quark fields belong here), where λa are the Gell-Mann matrices.\n\n7\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nThe invariance of the Lagrangian under local gauge transformations of the fields is\ndescribed by the following equations:\n\nψ(x)→ G(x)ψ(x), (2.6)\n\nψ̄(x)→ ψ̄(x)G†(x), (2.7)\n\nAµ(x)→ G(x)Aµ(x)G†(x)− i\n\ng\n[∂µG(x)]G†(x). (2.8)\n\nIn the functional integral formalism, the vacuum expectation values of an n-point op-\nerator can be obtained as\n\n〈0|T{O1(x1) ... On(xn)}|0〉 =\n\n∫\nDψDψ̄DAµO1(x1) ... On(xn) e i S[ψ, ψ̄, Aµ]∫\n\nDψDψ̄DAµ e i S[ψ, ψ̄, Aµ]\n, (2.9)\n\nwhere we have to integrate over all the possible field configurations to obtain the expecta-\ntion value.\n\nTo resolve the issue of wildly oscillating integrals due to the imaginary unit in the\nexponent, we proceed to change the metric from Minkowski to Euclidean. This is achieved\nby the transformation known as Wick-rotation, where we make a rotation in the complex\nplane by an angle−π/2 and change the currently used time τ to time t in Euclidean metric\nby\n\nτ → −i t. (2.10)\n\nWith the above transformation the action no longer has the imaginary factor and the expo-\nnential changes as eiS → e−SE , where the Euclidean action takes the form\n\nSE =\n\n∫\nd4xLE =\n\n∫\nd4x\n\n{\n1\n\n4\nF a\nµνF\n\na\nµν + ψ̄(γµDµ +m)ψ\n\n}\n. (2.11)\n\nThe final form of the functional integral then becomes\n\n〈0|T{O1(x1)...On(xn)}|0〉 =\n\n∫\nDψDψ̄DAµO1(x1)...On(xn) e−SE [ψ, ψ̄, Aµ]∫\n\nDψDψ̄DAµ e−SE [ψ, ψ̄, Aµ]\n. (2.12)\n\nTo calculate cross-sections and perturbative QCD (pQCD) processes, we use the func-\ntional integral formalism derived from the Euclidean action to obtain the Feynman rules\nfrom the QCD Lagrangian. These rules are then applied in the context of Feynman dia-\ngrams to compute scattering amplitudes [6].\n\n8\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n2.2.2 Properties of the Strong Interaction\n\nNow that we have discussed the form of the QCD Lagrangian, I briefly mention three\nimportant properties of the strong interaction, all of which has far-reaching consequences.\nOne of them is the phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom. It states that the (running)\ncoupling of the theory, denoted by αs, goes to zero at high energies (or short distances).\nDue to this property, QCD becomes amenable to the methods of perturbation theory at\nsufficiently high energies. The exact dependence of the strong coupling on the energy\nscale can be calculated using the renormalization group method.\n\nThe second important property of QCD is color confinement, namely that the coupling\nαs becomes larger at lower energy scales (or longer distance scales). As a consequence,\nusing the perturbation expansion in the coupling at low energy scales leads to a failure\ndue to the coefficients of the expansion being infinite. In the low-energy regime therefore\nnon-perturbative methods are required, the most successful being lattice gauge theory. An\nexperimental consequence of this property of the running coupling is that when two color\ncharges are being separated, the force between them remains constant while the energy\ngrows linearly, resulting in the breakup of the color string by the production of a quark-\nantiquark pair. This process repeats as long as sufficient energy is present. At the end,\nquarks and antiquarks will be confined into colorless states instead of acting as isolated\ncolor charges.\n\nThe third important property of QCD is the dynamical spontaneous breaking of chiral\nsymmetry, which generates masses for hadrons far above the mass scale of quarks, while\nmaking the masses of pseudoscalar mesons exceptionally low.\n\n2.2.3 The QCD Phase Diagram\n\nPart of the quest to understand the properties of strongly-interacting matter is to reveal the\nstructure of the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics. A phase diagram shows the\ndifferent phases in which matter can exist and also provides information on the required\nconditions for the phase transition to occur. The phase diagram of QCD is usually drawn as\na 2-dimensional diagram with the temperature on the vertical axis and the baryon chemical\npotential (or the net baryon density) on the horizontal axis, as it is shown in Fig. 2.2 (taken\nfrom [7]). Another important illustration is provided by the Columbia plots in Fig. 2.3\n(taken from [8]), which show two possible scenarios of the quark-mass dependence of the\nhadronic matter to QGP transition.\n\nAs it was mentioned earlier, we need to employ non-perturbative methods to fully de-\nscribe QCD due to the limitations of the perturbative approach. Lattice gauge theory is the\nmost successful non-perturbative theory, in which we discretize spacetime into a 4D lattice\nand try to solve the QCD equations numerically on a computer using Monte Carlo simu-\nlations. The success of this approach is well represented by the ab initio calculation of the\n\n9\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.2: A sketch of the QCD phase diagram.\n\nFigure 2.3: Two possible scenarios for the Columbia plot of QCD, which shows how the\nhadronic matter to QGP transition depends on the quark masses.\n\nlight hadron masses shown in Fig. 2.4 [9]. However, ab initio calculations in the domain\nof non-zero baryon number density are plagued by the infamous sign-problem, in which\nthe numerical evaluation of the QCD integrals fails because of the near-cancellation of the\nnegative and positive contributions to the integrals. There are multiple proposed solutions\nto alleviate the problem, such as reweighting the integrals, Taylor expansion around zero\nchemical potential, analytic continuation from purely imaginary chemical potentials, or\nthe complex Langevin method. Since none of these approaches work satisfactorily, only\na small region of the phase diagram can be successfully investigated with lattice QCD,\nwhich makes experimental measurements even more essential to guide the theory.\n\n10\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.4: The light hadron spectrum of QCD. Horizontal lines and bands are the ex-\nperimental values with their decay widths. Vertical error bars represent the combined\nstatistical and systematic errors. The π, K and Ξ hadrons were used to set the light quark\nmass, the strange quark mass and the overall scale, respectively.\n\n2.2.4 Hot & Cold QCD\n\nResearch of the strong interaction is sometimes divided into two categories: hot and cold\nQCD. The former aims to understand the emergence of the fluid behavior of the quark-\ngluon plasma (see Sec. 2.5) from the theory of QCD. Another important research area is\nto characterize the temperature and chemical potential dependence of the properties of the\nquark-gluon plasma.\n\nThe latter focuses on obtaining a complete picture of quarks and gluons giving rise\nto the spin, momentum and mass of the nucleons. Its focus includes the structure of\nthe hadrons, i.e. the description of the bound states of QCD in terms of the quarks and\ngluons, and the study of hadronization. Finally, it also studies the interactions of hadrons,\nincluding the effects due to the color flow in the collision processes.\n\n11\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n2.3 Monte Carlo Event Generators\nMonte Carlo (MC) event generators utilize pseudo-random sequences of numbers and\ncombine multiple theoretical and phenomenological models for different stages of a col-\nlision event to give a full, and best possible description of high-energy collisions. They\nprovide a fully exclusive final state in terms of particles which resembles the real-world\nexperiments as closely as possible, meaning that they generate events with the same prob-\nabilities as they occur in nature. Since many of the results in this thesis rely on data\nsimulated by MC event generators, and it also plays an essential role in the analysis of\nexperimental data both in the estimation of systematic uncertainties and to correct for de-\ntector effects, I give an overview of MC event generators in this section.\n\nAs the name suggests, MC event generators rely on Monte Carlo integration tech-\nniques, in which we numerically compute definite (usually) high-dimensional integrals\nutilizing pseudo-random numbers. Unlike regular integration techniques, we evaluate the\nintegrand at randomly chosen points of the integration space, instead of integrating on a\nregular grid [10]. A few important advantages of the MC integration are that it works in\narbitrarily complex integration regions and converges faster in higher dimensions, the er-\nror estimation is simple, multiple quantities can be evaluated at the same time, and a good\nestimation is achievable with relatively few sample size. A disadvantage is that in low\ndimensions this method converges slowly.\n\nThere are multiple techniques to perform MC integration, one of the most important\nbeing the importance sampling method, in which we sample the integrand with such a\nprobability distribution that the most significant contributions are the most likely to be part\nof the sample [11]. It is important to note that the error convergence of MC simulations\ngoes as 1/\n\n√\nN with the sample size N . The error scales the same even if we generalize\n\nthe simulations to higher dimensions.\nThe simulation of high-energy collision events requires performing so many integra-\n\ntions that Monte Carlo techniques are the only viable options. Event generators carry out\nthe event simulation in the following phases: hard process, multiple scatterings, parton\nshower, hadronization, hadronic rescattering, secondary decays. In general we can catego-\nrize the MC generators into two classes: general purpose event generators and specialized\nevent generators. Typically we use a combination of both.\n\nThe hard processes normally involve 2 → 2 (or in some cases 2 → 3) scatterings,\nand many specialized programs are available for the calculation of matrix elements of\nhigh-multiplicity final states. To calculate the cross sections, we first need to calculate the\nmatrix element for a given phase space point, and do an integration over the phase space\nregion of interest (depending on the particular cuts). Since the matrix elements can have\nmultiple peaks and singularities, integrating them over the phase space is often the most\nchallenging part.\n\n12\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nSome of the most commonly used MC generators are PYTHIA [12], HERWIG [13, 14],\nSHERPA [15], POWHEG [16–18] and EPOS3 [19]. In the following subsections, I describe\nsome of them in more details, to provide background for the results presented in this thesis.\n\n2.3.1 PYTHIA 8\n\nPYTHIA 8 is a general-purpose event generator for high-energy particle collisions, which\nwas written from scratch in C++ as a successor to PYTHIA 6. Its physics base includes\nconcepts such as soft and hard processes, parton showers, multiple-parton interactions\n(MPI) and string fragmentation.\n\nPYTHIA models a basic hard scattering process with leading-order pQCD calculations,\ncombined with initial- and final-state radiations as well as MPI at the partonic level. The\nhadronic final state is produced using Lund string fragmentation, and then secondary de-\ncays and rescattering between hadrons are computed, forming the final state of the col-\nlision. Since many physical details cannot be derived from first principles due to our\nlimited understanding of Nature, the MC event generators, including PYTHIA, require ex-\ntra input parameters. Determining these parameters are far from trivial, and a given set\nof parameters are generally sufficient only for reproducing certain experimental data. A\ngiven configuration of these parameters, optimized for reproducing experimental results in\ncertain physical aspects, are called tunes.\n\nThe Monash 2013 tune is mainly focused on describing the minimum-bias and under-\nlying event (UE) distributions accurately. The Monash tune uses the NNPDF2.3LO PDF\nset [20], is specifically configured to both e+e− and pp/pp̄ data [21]. MonashStar (or\nCUETP8M1-NNPDF2.3LO) is an underlying event tune based on the Monash tune and\nwas configured to CMS data [22]. The 4C tune is a newer one introduced with PYTHIA ver-\nsion 8.145 [23]. It is based on the tune 2C, but it uses the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [24] and has\nfurther changes including a reduced cross section for diffraction and modified multiple-\nparton interaction parameters to produce a higher and more rapidly increasing charged\npseudorapidity plateau for better agreement with some early key LHC numbers [25].\n\nThe Angantyr Model\n\nPYTHIA 8 does not natively support collisions involving nuclei, therefore this feature is\nimplemented separately in the Angantyr model, which combines several nucleon–nucleon\ncollisions to build a proton–nucleus (p–A) or nucleus–nucleus (A–A) collision. In this\nmodel some modifications are made over the dynamics of pp collisions. The Angantyr\nmodel improves the inclusive definition of collision types of the FRITIOF model [26, 27].\nIn this model a projectile nucleon can interact with several target nucleons where one\nprimary collision looks like a typical pp non-diffractive (ND) collision. However, other\ntarget nucleons may also undergo ND collisions with the projectile.\n\n13\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nThe Angantyr model treats secondary ND collisions as modified single-diffractive\n(SD) interactions. For every p–A or A–A collision, nucleons are distributed randomly\ninside a nucleus based on a Glauber formalism similar to the one described in Ref. [28].\nThis model is able to correctly reproduce final-state observables of heavy-ion collisions,\ni.e., multiplicity and pT distributions [29]. As explicit hydrodynamic evolution is not incor-\nporated in this model, its predictions serve as a baseline for studying observables sensitive\nto collective behavior in p–A and A–A systems.\n\n2.3.2 HIJING++\n\nHIJING++ (Heavy Ion Jet INteraction Generator) [30, 31] is the successor of the widely\nused original HIJING [32, 33], completely rewritten in C++ from scratch. The main moti-\nvation during the development was to obtain an event generator that is easily maintainable,\nextensible and works effectively with high throughput. It contains all the physical models\nthat were also present in HIJING, but removes some of its limitations. It includes native\nthread based parallelism, an easy-to-use analysis interface and a modular plugin system,\nwhich makes room for possible future improvements. An initial tune of the parameters\nwas performed for RHIC and LHC energies.\n\nHIJING++ implements a mechanism for creating the underlying event and QCD effects\non the soft-hard boundary differently from PYTHIA. It uses the PYTHIA jet fragmentation,\nbut instead of MPI as implemented in PYTHIA, HIJING++ uses minijet production.\n\n2.3.3 EPOS3\n\nThe EPOS3 event generator is largely used for the description of ultra-relativistic heavy-\nion collisions. It employs a core-corona description of the fireball produced in these colli-\nsions: in its inner part, the ”core”, the quark–gluon plasma is formed, which evolves based\non hydrodynamic description, while in the external regions of the ”corona” the partons\nfragment and hadronize independently. A study of radial flow performed with the EPOS3\nevent generator in proton–proton collisions at\n\n√\ns = 7 TeV [34] has shown that the en-\n\nergy density reached in such collisions is large enough to grant the applicability of the\nhydrodynamic evolution to the core of the collision.\n\n14\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n2.4 Jets\nJets are the collimated sprays of hadrons created from the hard scattering of partons\n(quarks and gluons) by fragmentation and hadronization. Their existence is a direct con-\nsequence of the confinement property of QCD (see Section 2.2.2). Quark and gluon jets\nradiate proportionally to their color factors, which makes it possible to differentiate be-\ntween them experimentally. Quark jet fragmentation is also sensitive to the flavor of the\ninitiating quark because of the mass-dependent dead-cone effect [35, 36].\n\n2.4.1 Kinematic variables\n\nA particle with energy E, intrinsic mass m and impulse ~p is denoted by the four-vector pµ\n= (E, ~p) = (E, px, py, pz), using the convention c = 1. The component of the impulse\nparallel to the beam direction is called the longitudinal component and is denoted by pL.\nSince the z-axis of the coordinate system is usually chosen to be parallel to the beam\ndirection, the longitudinal component of the impulse is simply pL = pz. The transverse\ncomponent of the impulse is pT =\n\n√\np2\n\nx + p2\ny, which falls in the plane vertical to the beam\n\ndirection.\nTo describe the relativistic kinematics of a particle in the z direction, we can introduce\n\na Lorentz-additive quantity, rapidity, as y = 1\n2\nlnE+pz\nE−pz . In practice we often use the pseu-\n\ndorapidity η, calculated as η = 1\n2\nln |~p|+pz|~p|−pz = −ln[tan( θ\n\n2\n)], where θ is the angle between the\n\nparticle and beam axis. In the low-mass or ultra-relativistic limit (pL � m) the pseudora-\npidity is equivalent to the rapidity. The 3rd degree of freedom is usually expressed by the\nazimuth angle φ, perpendicular to the beam direction.\n\n2.4.2 Jet Reconstruction\n\nSince jets reach the detector as a set of multiple particles, they first need to be reconstructed\nfrom collision data, before any of their properties can be determined. In practice the re-\nconstruction is done by utilizing jet reconstruction algorithms, which serve as an interface\nbetween theory and experiment [37].\n\nThe earliest jet algorithms, such as the SisCone algorithm, suffered from the lack\nof ”collinear” and ”infrared” safety. Collinear safety means that predictions remain un-\nchanged under collinear (parallel) particle emissions, while infrared safety ensures pre-\ndictions are unaffected by low-energy (soft) particle emissions, both crucial for reliable\ntheoretical calculations. In the following, I focus on collinear and infrared-safe state-of-\nthe-art sequential recombination algorithms. These algorithms start from a list of particles,\nand recombine them step-by-step to form the jet. A distance is first defined between two\nparticles (indexed by i and j) as ∆R2\n\nij = (φi − φj)2 + (ηi − ηj)2, where φ is the azimuth\nangle and η is the pseudorapidity coordinates of the particle. We also define a pT-weighted\n\n15\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\ndistance as\n\ndij = min(p2p\nTi, p\n\n2p\nTj)\n\n∆R2\nij\n\nR2\n, (2.13)\n\nwhere R is the resolution parameter, corresponding to the size of the jet. The resolution\nparameter is typically chosen to be a number between 0.2 and 1.0, depending on the colli-\nsion system and the physics goals of the particular analysis. Heavy-ion collision analyses\ntend to use smaller resolution parameters due to the underlying event contribution.\n\nThe parameter p in Eq. 2.13 is typically chosen to take one of the following three\nvalues: p = 1 corresponds to the kT algorithm [38], p = 0 corresponds to the Cambridge-\nAachen algorithm [39], and p = −1 corresponds to the anti-kT algorithm [40]. The jet\nreconstruction algorithms then work as follows:\n\n• Calculate the distance dij between every pair of final state particles, and the distance\ndiB to the beam.\n\n• Find the minimum between dij and diB.\n\n• If the minimum is the dij then combine the ith and jth particles and go back to step\n1.\n\n• If the minimum is the diB then the ith particle is a final state jet and so remove it\nfrom the list of particles and go back to Step 1.\n\n• Repeat the above steps until no particles left.\n\nThe three main jet algorithms have their advantages and disadvantages, so it is impor-\ntant to understand when to prefer one over the other. The kT algorithm is usually utilized\nby theorists, but it is less favored by experimentalists due to the high computational cost\n(scales with N3 or N log(N) in FASTJET [41]). The Cambridge-Aachen algorithm clus-\nters the particles based only on their geometry and has the same disadvantage as the former\nalgorithm by being slow and not producing circular shaped jets. However, an advantage\nto this algorithm is that it reflects the angular ordering of the hadrons inside the recon-\nstructed jet. Perhaps the most widely used algorithm is the anti-kT algorithm, which starts\nthe clustering with the most energetic particles and grows the jet around this seed. The\nadvantage of such clustering are the resulting approximately circular shaped jet areas, but\nthe disadvantage is the lower efficiency of capturing the branching processes inside the\njets, illustrated in Fig. 2.5 (taken from [40]).\n\n16\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.5: Illustration of the resulting jet areas for different jet reconstruction algorithms.\n\n2.4.3 Jet Shapes\n\nMore information can be obtained on jet fragmentation by studying the jet substructure.\nJet shapes are one such class of observables, which measure the average distribution of\nenergy flow within the jets. Their usefulness involves them being a good tool for testing\nshowering models in MC generators, help discriminate between different underlying event\nmodels, and could even help in searches for new physics. An interesting application is to\nuse them to separate quark and gluon jets, due to this observable being sensitive to the\nquark/gluon mixture.\n\nTwo widely used observables to describe the momentum distribution inside the jets are\nthe differential jet shape ρ and the integrated jet shape Ψ (see Fig. 2.6, taken from [42]).\nThe differential jet shape describes the radial transverse momentum distribution inside the\njet cone and is defined as follows:\n\nρ(r) =\n1\n\nδr\n\n1\n\npjet\nT\n\n∑\nra<ri<rb\n\npiT , (2.14)\n\n17\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.6: Illustration of the differential jet shape (left) and integrated jet shape (right).\n\nwhere piT is the transverse momentum of a particle inside a δr wide annulus with an\ninner radius ra = r − δr/2 and an outer radius rb = r + δr/2 concentric to the jet\naxis and pjet\n\nT is the transverse momentum of the jet (i.e. a four-momentum sum of the\njet constituents). The distance of a given particle from the jet axis is given by ri =√\n\n(φi − φjet)2 + (ηi − ηjet)2, where φ denotes the azimuth and η denotes the pseudo-\nrapidity.\n\nThe integrated jet shape is defined as the average fraction of the jet transverse momen-\ntum inside a cone of radius r concentric to the jet axis and is calculated as\n\nΨ(r) =\n1\n\npjet\nT\n\n∑\nri<r\n\npiT , (2.15)\n\nwhere the symbols denote the same quantities as for the differential jet shape. The differ-\nential and integral jet shapes are connected through the following relations if there is no\ndiscretization:\n\nΨ(r) =\n\n∫ r\n\n0\n\nρ(r′)dr′ , and Ψ(r = R) =\n\n∫ R\n\n0\n\nρ(r′)dr′ = 1 , (2.16)\n\nwhere R is the jet resolution parameter, i.e. the size of the jet.\n\n18\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n2.5 The Quark–Gluon Plasma\nA new phase of strongly interacting matter has long been predicted by both phenomeno-\nlogical considerations and lattice QCD calculations. A phase transition was expected from\nordinary hadronic matter to a deconfined phase of strongly interacting quarks and gluon,\nif the temperature (energy density) is sufficiently large [43–45]. This predicted state of\nmatter, first referred to as the quark-gluon plasma in Ref. [46], is assumed to have existed\nin the early stages of the universe. In the laboratory we can create this matter by colliding\nheavy nuclei together in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. One of the main goals of\nbuilding large heavy-ion colliders was to find and study the properties of the QGP.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a new phase of strongly interacting matter was found at the Rel-\nativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [47–50]. The initial temperature of this matter was\nfound to be above the limit where hadronic material can exist, proving that QGP comes\ninto existence in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Contrary to expectations, this matter\nwas found to be strongly coupled (sQGP). In this section I detail the properties of this\nextremely hot and dense matter, and describe the experimental signatures through which\nit can be studied, such as particle yields, spectra (momentum distributions) and particle\ncorrelations.\n\n2.5.1 Suppression of High-pT Hadrons and Jets\n\nQuarks and gluons do not exist in free form due to color confinement. After the initial in-\nteraction of partons during a collision event, they are leaving the vicinity of the interaction\npoint and fragment into hadrons while forming a narrow cone of hadrons, called jets (see\nSec. 2.4). The original partons can be studied through these jets that we measure in our\ndetectors. Interactions with large momentum and energy transfer are referred to as hard\nprocesses, and in these elementary hard processes most jets are produced in back-to-back\npairs.\n\nSince the deconfined phase of QGP is strongly interacting, the created medium of this\nmatter is opaque for partons that carry color charge, which causes the medium traversing\njets to lose energy. Statistically the quark-antiquark pair is created asymmetrically in the\nmedium, i.e. not in the center of the medium, therefore one of the jets can escape the\nmedium faster, while the other one of the pair has to traverse the medium. In this case we\nexpect a suppression in the detected jets, which we call jet quenching. An illustration is\nshown in Fig. 2.7 (taken from [51]).\n\nOne of the first important results in the study of the QGP is the observed suppression\nof hadrons in heavy-ion collisions, which is a clear sign of a strongly interacting QGP. The\nPHENIX experiment at RHIC measured the spectra of identified hadrons in both pp and\nAu–Au collisions at the same\n\n√\nsNN = 130 GeV center-of-mass energy per nucleon [52].\n\nThe hadron spectra in pp was scaled with the average number of binary (nuclear–nuclear)\n\n19\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.7: Illustration of jet quenching. One quark goes out directly to the vacuum,\nradiates a few gluons, and hadronizes. The other quark goes through the dense plasma that\nis formed in the collision, suffers energy loss due to medium-induced gluon radiation, and\nfinally fragments outside into a quenched jet. The plasma is characterized by a transport\ncoefficient q̂, temperature T , and gluon density dNg/dy.\n\ncollisionsNcoll which happen in a Au–Au collision, then the scaled pp spectra was divided\nby the Au–Au spectra. This ratio is the nuclear modification factor RAA and any deviation\nfrom unity indicates a mechanism that is a feature only of central heavy-ion collisions.\nThe RAA for a hadron is defined as\n\nRh\nAA(pT, η) =\n\n1\n\n〈Ncoll〉\n\n(\nd2σAA→h\n\ndpTdη\n\n)(\nd2σpp→h\n\ndpTdη\n\n)−1\n\n, (2.17)\n\nwhere σ denotes the cross section of the particular process. A summary of important\nmeasurements ofRAA for three different center-of-mass energies is shown in Fig. 2.8 [53].\nThe value ofRAA is significantly reduced for both charged and neutral hadrons over a wide\npT range. At RHIC energies a strong suppression is clearly visible in the range relevant\nfor pQCD (pT & 4 GeV/c).\n\n20\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.8: Measurements of the nuclear modification factorRAA in central heavy-ion col-\nlisions at three different center-of-mass energies, for neutral pions (π0), charged hadrons\n(h±), and charged particles and compared to several theoretical predictions.\n\nThe STAR experiment also measured the angular correlation of the leading (most en-\nergetic) hadrons of jets at mid-rapidity in\n\n√\nsNN = 200 GeV Au–Au collisions, shown\n\nin Fig. 2.9 (taken from [48]). The angular correlations are compared across different\ncollisions systems, and a clear absence of the back-to-back correlation peak is missing,\nconfirming the predicted pehnomenon of jet quenching. Jet suppression in the high-\nmomentum region of heavy-ion collisions was also reported by the STAR Collabora-\ntion [54].\n\nIt is an important question whether the jet quenching should be attributed to initial or\nfinal state effects. As a supplementary measurement therefore, the PHENIX Collaboration\nmeasured the particle production in d–Au at the same\n\n√\nsNN = 200 GeV energy. The\n\nsame binary scaling was observed as in peripheral Au–Au collisions, but there was no\nsuppression visible [55]. This measurement provided strong evidence that the suppression\nis in the final state, i.e. a new state of matter is created that is only present in high-energy\n\n21\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.9: High-pT dihadron azimuthal correlation measurement at\n√\nsNN = 200 GeV for\n\npp, central d–Au and central Au–Au collisions (background subtracted) from the STAR\nCollaboration.\n\ncollisions of heavy ions, where the system has a sufficiently large size.\nAs we discussed, the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is a strongly\n\ninteracting medium. Photons, however, do not have color charge therefore the QGP is a\nnearly transparent medium for them. Especially useful are direct photons, i.e. which are\nproduced from sources other than hadronic decays, as their production is sensitive to the\nearly stages of the reaction. The direct photons carry information on the hard process,\ntherefore it can be used as a control measurement for hadron suppression. Such a direct\nphoton measurement was carried out by the PHENIX Collaboration in Au–Au collisions\nat\n√\nsNN = 200 GeV and showed that the nuclear modification factor for photons is con-\n\nsistent with unity in the mid-pT ranges, confirming that the hadron suppression is indeed\ncaused by strongly interacting matter [56]. Here I also mention that measuring the thermal\nphotons can provide information on the temperature of the QGP (see Sec. 2.5.3).\n\n2.5.2 A Perfect Fluid of Quarks\n\nWhile the observed jet quenching phenomenon at RHIC proved the existence of a new\nphase of matter, the RHIC experiments uniformly found substantial azimuthal anisotropy\nin measurements of several particle types, that could only be explained by assuming a\nstrongly coupled QGP that behaves as a liquid rather than like a gas. This observation was\n\n22\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\ncompletely against our naive expectations from asymptotic freedom. It became clear that\nthe most important properties of this matter can be only accessed through soft processes:\nthese processes have relatively small momentum transfer, therefore pQCD calculations\ncannot be used for their analysis.\n\nThe multiplicity distribution of the bulk of the particles with lower momenta exhibits\na dependency as\n\ndN\n\ndφ\n≈ 1 + 2ν2(pT) cos(2φ) , (2.18)\n\nwhere φ is the angle with the reaction plane, defined by the (parallel) trajectories of the\ncolliding nuclei, and ν2 is the so-called elliptic flow parameter. This is a direct hydrody-\nnamical consequence of the elliptic shape of the nucleus overlapping during the initial state\nof the collision. This pressure-anisotropy of the initial state then results in the anisotropy\nof the momentum distribution of the final state (see Fig. 2.10, taken from [57]).\n\nFigure 2.10: Illustration of the elliptic flow. The pressure anisotropy of the initial state\nshows up as momentum distribution anisotropy in the final state. The expanding ellipsoidal\nregion of hot quark matter has a principal axis perpendicular to the reaction plane.\n\nLater measurements also found that the viscosity over entropy ratio of this strongly-\ninteracting fluid is at least an order of magnitude less than the viscosity of super-fluid\nhelium, which makes it the most perfect fluid that we currently know. Furthermore, a new\nscaling property was also found when the ν2 elliptic flow parameter was measured versus\nthe transverse kinetic energy. After rescaling with the number of constituent quarks, all\nhadrons lay on the same curve, which shows a number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling\nbehavior of the elliptic flow. This clearly proved that the degrees of freedom are quarks,\nand the viscosity was measured to be at the quantum limit, hence the QGP is a perfect fluid\nof deconfined quarks (see Fig. 2.11, taken from [58]).\n\n23\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.11: Scaling of hadrons in the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. (a) Elliptic flow\nparameter ν2 vs. transverse kinetic energy in\n\n√\nsNN = 200 GeV Au–Au collisions. (b)\n\nThe same data but scaled by the number of constituent quarks nq. The different types of\nhadrons lay on the same curve.\n\n2.5.3 The Temperature of the QGP\n\nAs it was mentioned in the previous section, the RHIC experiments found a new, extremely\nhot and dense state of matter, which behaves more like a liquid than a gaseous phase. The\nobservation of thermal photons in principle allows the access of the thermal properties,\ne.g. the determination of the initial temperature of this matter, but the precision of low-\npT direct photon measurements is limited due to the large background from the hadronic\ndecay photons. The leptons on the other hand are excellent tools for studying the heavy-\nion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. They do not carry color charge and therefore\nare unaffected by the strong interaction, which allows them to escape the dense medium\nwithout any final state interaction. For example, measuring the dilepton spectra can probe\nthe complete time evolution and dynamics of heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, any source\nof high-energy photons emit virtual photons which convert into low-mass e+e− pairs. The\nvirtual photon production then can be related to the direct photon production itself, thus\nthe direct photon yield can be reconstructed from dileption measurements [59].\n\nThe PHENIX experiment measured the thermal photon spectrum using virtual photons\ndecaying to electron–positron pairs in central Au–Au collisions. From the slope of the\nspectrum, the temperature of the QGP could be inferred. The inverse slope parameter is\nT = 221 ± 19(stat) ± 19(syst) MeV, and based on this the initial temperature could be\nestimated using hydro-dynamical models to fall between 300 − 600 MeV, corresponding\nto 2-4 trillion Kelvins. Since this temperature is substantially higher than the Hagedorn\ntemperature (TH ≈ 160 MeV) [60] above which matter cannot exist in a hadronic phase\nanymore, it is a direct proof to the existence of the strongly interacting QGP.\n\n24\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n2.5.4 Collectivity in Small Systems\n\nCollective behavior in ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy ions has long been interpreted\nas a signature of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma. Surprisingly, small collision\nsystems, such as pp and p–Pb collisions, at high center-of-mass energies show similar col-\nlective features to those observed in events of heavy-ion collisions with comparable multi-\nplicities. These observations, including long-range near-side correlations and vn (“flow”)\ncoefficients [61, 62] (see Fig. 2.12, taken from [62]), may also question the signatures\npreviously considered as definite signs of the QGP. An intensively researched question\nin high-energy physics is therefore whether small droplets of quark-gluon plasma can\nform in collisions of small systems. Whether the collective behavior may be attributed\nto the presence of a deconfined state in small systems is an open question. However,\npossible medium-like effects in pp collisions may also question the widely exploited as-\nsumption that pp collisions are safe to use as a reference for heavy-ion systems. Recent\nstudies showed that flow patterns may emerge from features different than hydrodynam-\nics. For instance, radial flow in pp collisions may be explained by pure QCD mecha-\nnisms such as multiple-parton interactions (MPI) [34]. Alternative explanations also ex-\nist for the observed collectivity in small colliding systems, such as calculations based\non Color Glass Condensate initial states with Lund fragmentation [63] or non-Abelian\nBremsstrahlung [64].\n\nFigure 2.12: Two-dimensional two-particle correlation functions are shown for 7 TeV in\npp collisions, for minimum bias events (left) and high-multiplicity events (right). The\nsharp near-side peak from jet correlations was cut off in order to better illustrate the struc-\nture outside that region.\n\nRecent analyses of pp and p–Pb collisions also show a universal enhancement of\nheavy-flavor particles, that is usually attributed to MPI and higher gluon radiation as-\nsociated with short distance production processes [65]. However, we lack the qualitative\n\n25\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nunderstanding of these effects. While we cannot expect to observe direct modification of\nparticle yields by any medium created in collisions of small systems (because of the small\nvolume of such a medium), phenomena that act in the soft-hard transitional regime should\nin principle pose an effect on hard processes as well. A modification in the shapes of\ndeveloping jets can in principle be accessible by existing experiments.\n\nIn recent years a consensus starts to emerge that the observed collective phenomena\ncould be explained by semi-soft vacuum-QCD effects, such as multiparton-interactions [66]\nwith color-reconnection [34] or minijets (semi-hard partons produced by incoming partons\nor bremsstrahlung) [67] production.\n\n2.6 Heavy Flavor\nThe Standard Model has 6 quark flavors (see Sec. 2.1), of which the three heaviest, the\ncharm, beauty and top quarks, are referred to as heavy-flavor quarks. Hadrons which\ncontain heavy quarks are usually called heavy flavor particles. The top quark has the\nhighest mass not only among the quarks, but also among the currently known elementary\nparticles, and because it decays before it could hadronize, it is usually not included in\nheavy-flavor analyses [68].\n\n2.6.1 Production of Heavy Flavor\n\nThere are two mechanisms that generate quark masses with different degrees of impor-\ntance, depending on the energy scale: bare quark masses (also called naked or current\nquark masses) are generated by the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism (Higgs\nmass), while the constituent quark masses in QCD (QCD mass) are the results of the spon-\ntaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The light quark (u, d, s) masses are strongly affected\nby the QCD interaction, while the heavy quark (c, b, t) masses are mainly determined\nby the Higgs mechanism. This interplay in the generation of quark masses is shown in\nFig. 2.13 (taken from [69]). Heavy quarks are mostly created in the early stages of the\ncollision, in processes which are accessible with perturbative quantum chromodynamics\n(pQCD) calculations: a heavy quark can be created from a pair of gluons or light quarks\nby flavor creation (FLC), a gluon splitting into the quark-antiquark pair (GSP), or through\nflavor excitation (FLX) [70, 71]. They may also interact in semi-hard processes and par-\nticipate in the formation of the underlying event [72]. The heavy-quark production is also\nsensitive to the parton distribution function. Heavy quarks are an ideal probe to study\nthe properties of the hot and dense medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions, be-\ncause unlike the light quark masses, heavy quark masses are much higher than the initial\nexcitation of the system and are therefore not modified by the surrounding QCD medium.\n\n26\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.13: Quark masses in the QCD vacuum and the Higgs vacuum. A large fraction\nof the light quark masses is due to the chiral symmetry breaking of the QCD vacuum.\n\nStudying heavy-flavor quark production serves as a useful tool across multiple colli-\nsion systems [73–77]. In pp collisions we can test perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions\nthrough the measurement of cross sections. We can also test the parton shower through\nthe dead-cone effect [35, 36] (mass ordering) and Casimir color factor (color charge ef-\nfect). The measurement of heavy-flavor production also provides means to test fragmen-\ntation models. Jet structure may reveal flavor dependence stemming from mass and color\ncharge effects, while the comparison of the charm mesonic and baryonic sector can re-\nveal quark coalescence processes and the effect of color junctions. Another crucial role\nof heavy/flavor measurements is to provide baseline for similar measurements in p–Pb\nand Pb–Pb collisions. Collisions of p–Pb systems are useful to isolate the initial state\nand cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects and can serve as tools for studies of possible col-\nlective effects. In Pb–Pb collisions, heavy flavor is produced before the QGP can form\n(m � TQGP), and experiences the full evolution of the medium. They experience energy\nloss via gluon radiation and collisions, and thus can be used to probe the dynamical and\nthermal properties of the medium.\n\n27\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nThe production of heavy-flavor hadrons in high-energy collisions is usually described\nby the factorization approach, in which the production cross section of the heavy-flavor\nparticles is expressed as a convolution of three independent terms:\n\ndσhard\nAB→C = Σa,bfa/A(xa, Q\n\n2)⊗ fb/B(xb, Q\n2)⊗ dσhard\n\nab→c ⊗Dc→C(z,Q2) , (2.19)\n\nwhere the first two terms are the parton distribution functions (PDF) of the incoming\nhadrons, the third term is the parton-parton hard scattering cross section, and the last term\nis the fragmentation function (FF). The hard parton cross sections can be derived using\nperturbative QCD calculations, as the large mass of the heavy quark establishes the hard\nscale, allowing production to be computed down to low transverse momentum. However,\nthe PDFs and FFs need to be obtained through measurements. The pQCD factorization is\nillustrated for dijet production in Fig. 2.14 (taken from [78]).\n\nFigure 2.14: Illustration of the pQCD factorization in dijet production in hadronic col-\nlisions: fa/A(x1, Q\n\n2) are the PDFs, Di→h(z,Q\n2) the FFs, and ISR (FSR) represents the\n\ninitial (final)-state radiation.\n\nThe production cross sections of several open heavy-flavor hadrons and of their decay\nleptons in pp collisions were measured at both mid- and forward-rapidity at the LHC [79–\n85]. The production cross sections are described by pQCD calculations [86–88] with large\ntheoretical uncertainties.\n\n28\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n2.6.2 Heavy-flavor Jets and Correlations\n\nThe pattern of the parton shower is influenced by the mass of the emitting parton due\nto a phenomenon known as the dead-cone effect. The dead-cone effect is a fundamental\naspect of all gauge field theories, that causes radiation with energy E off an emitter of\nmass m to be suppressed at angular scales smaller than m/E relative to the emitter’s\ndirection [35]. The dead-cone effect has been observed by the ALICE experiment for the\nfirst time [36]. Jet and two-particle angular correlation measurements allow for the flavor-\ndependent characterization of parton shower and fragmentation. Recent jet substructure\nmeasurements allow for the detailed understanding of jet development.\n\nThe reconstruction of jets containing heavy-flavor hadrons provides a more direct ac-\ncess to the primary heavy-flavor parton kinematics compared to the inclusive measure-\nments of heavy-flavor hadrons. Heavy-flavor jet measurements allow studying the produc-\ntion and fragmentation effects separately. The ALICE detector has excellent tracking capa-\nbilities for low-pT charged particles, which makes it possible to measure heavy-flavor jets\ndown to low transverse momenta. Jets containing a D0 meson have been measured by the\nALICE experiment in proton–proton collisions at several energies [89, 90]. It was found\nthat pQCD-based models generally well describe the data within uncertainties. More re-\ncent groomed substructure measurements of D0 jets show significant differences between\ncharm jets and jets initiated by light quarks and gluons [91]. The first measurement of\ninclusive charged-particle b-jet pT-differential cross section and the b-jet fraction was re-\nported by the ALICE experiment [92]. Since heavy-flavor jet tagging is challenging at\nlow-momenta, the correlation measurements can be used to provide insight into heavy-\nflavor jet properties at low transverse momentum.\n\nThe typical structure of a two-particle angular correlation distribution of high pT trig-\nger particles with associated charged particles features a ”near-side” (NS) peak at coordi-\nnates (∆ϕ,∆η) = (0, 0), where ∆ϕ is the difference in azimuth angle between the trig-\nger and associated particles, and ∆η is their pseudorapidity difference. There is also an\n”away-side” (AS) peak at ∆ϕ = π, which extends over a wide pseudorapidity range. The\nNS peak is mainly created by particles emerging from the fragmentation of the parton that\nproduced the trigger particle. The AS peak is related to the fragmentation of the other par-\nton produced in the hard scattering. The correlation peaks lie on top of an approximately\nflat continuum extending over the full (∆ϕ,∆η) range [93]. By varying the pT interval of\nthe trigger and associated particles, the correlation measurements allow the detailed study\nof jet fragmentation, such as the jet angular profile and the momentum distribution of the\nparticles produced in the fragmentation of the hard parton.\n\nThe azimuthal correlation distributions of prompt D mesons and charged particles were\nmeasured by the ALICE Collaboration in pp collisions at\n\n√\ns = 5.02 TeV,\n\n√\ns = 7 TeV,\n\nand\n√\ns = 13 TeV [93–95]. Measuring the correlation distribution between heavy-flavor\n\ndecay electrons and charged particles provides a substantially larger sample of correlation\n\n29\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\npairs, compared to measuring the azimuthal correlations of D mesons and charged parti-\ncles [93, 94]. The larger sample allows to significantly extend the passoc\n\nT range of associated\nparticles to provide a more complete picture of the heavy quark fragmentation. In addition,\nelectrons originating from beauty-hadron decays (b→ (c→) e) dominate the heavy-flavor\nhadron decay electron spectrum (> 50%) at high pe\n\nT (> 5 GeV/c) [96]. Hence, probing\nlarge enough trigger electron transverse momenta enables the study of the correlation func-\ntion of particles originating from beauty-hadron decays, and provides information on the\ndifferent correlation structures for charm and beauty quarks. This additional information\ncan be used to further constrain MC simulations. The mentioned advantages have a cost,\nhowever, because an additional smearing is introduced in the correlation function, due to\nthe non-zero angle between the direction of the trigger electron and the parent heavy-flavor\nhadron before its decay. The momentum of the electron can also be further away from the\nquark momentum compared to that of the parent hadron, due to the kinematics of its decay.\n\nIn proton–nucleus (p–A) collisions, several CNM effects can influence the produc-\ntion, fragmentation, and hadronization of heavy quarks. In the initial state, the parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs) are modified in bound nucleons as compared to free nucle-\nons [97–99]. Color-Glass Condensate calculations [100–102] predicts momentum cor-\nrelations in the initial state, that would impact the angular correlations of the produced\nheavy-quark pairs. The CGC predicts momentum correlations in the initial state, that\nwould impact the angular correlations of the produced heavy-quark pairs. Partons may\nundergo multiple scatterings in the nucleus during the initial state and interact in the high-\ndensity environment in the final state, especially in high-multiplicity collisions [103, 104].\nThese effects can be studied by measuring changes in the angular shape or associated-\nparticle peak yields of the angular correlation distributions of heavy-flavor particles with\ncharged hadrons [93, 94]. Measurements of azimuthal correlations of prompt Dmesons\nand charged hadrons in p–Pb collisions by the ALICE collaboration[93, 94] showed that\nthe near- and away-side peaks are consistent with those in pp collisions in the same kine-\nmatic region. Using heavy-flavor decay electrons as trigger particles instead of prompt D\nmesons allows studying cold-nuclear-matter effects over a wider associated particle passoc\n\nT\n\nrange and investigating their impact on beauty-quark fragmentation and hadronization.\nTwo-particle angular correlations have been extensively used to understand radiation pat-\nterns and to probe the medium response to the high-pT parton. A recent measurement of\nangular correlations between D mesons and charged particles in Au–Au collisions by the\nSTAR Collaboration [105], shows a significant modification of the near-side peak width\nand associated yield, which increases from peripheral to central collisions. Correlations\nbetween electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays and charged particles measured by\nPHENIX reveal modifications in the away-side peak yield and width in Au–Au compared\nto pp collisions [106]. For future heavy-flavor hadron correlation studies in heavy-ion col-\nlisions at the LHC, similar measurements in pp and p–Pb collisions are essential to serve\nas references [107].\n\n30\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nIn Chapter 6, I present my work on an analysis of the azimuthal correlations of heavy-\nflavor decay electrons with charged particles in pp and p–Pb collisions with the ALICE\nexperiment [108].\n\n2.6.3 Fragmentation of Charm Baryons\n\nRecent measurements of charm-baryon production at midrapidity in pp collisions are not\nreproduced by pQCD calculations and event generators adopting a fragmentation model\ntuned on e+e− data [109–114]. In Fig. 2.15, a recent measurement of the ALICE Col-\nlaboration shows the cross-section ratios of Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 and Σ0,+,++\n\nc /D0, comparing them to\nmodel predictions. The cross-section ratio values in pp collisions at\n\n√\ns = 13 TeV are\n\ncompatible with values measured at\n√\ns = 5.02 TeV within uncertainties. The Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 ra-\n\ntio is observed to decrease with increasing pT and is, however, significantly larger than the\n≈ 0.12 values observed in e+e− and ep collisions at several collision energies [115–119],\ntherefore a remarkable difference between the collision systems of pp and e+e− is present\nin the experimental data.\n\nFigure 2.15: Prompt-charm-hadron cross-section ratios in pp at\n√\ns = 13 TeV: Λ+\n\nc /D\n0\n\n(left), Σ0,+,++\nc /D0 (middle) and Λ+\n\nc ← Σ0,+,++\nc /Λ+\n\nc (right), compared with model predic-\ntions and also data frompp at\n\n√\ns = 5.02 TeV [111].\n\nThese conclusions are supported by the fact that while simulations performed with the\ndefault version of PYTHIA 6.2 reasonably reproduce Belle data [120], the default version\nof PYTHIA 8.243 (Monash 2013 tune) severely under-predicts ALICE data, despite the\nvery similar modelling of charm fragmentation in the two simulations.\n\nAs Fig. 2.15 shows, a better description of these measurements can be obtained by\nmodels including hadronization mechanisms such as quark coalescence [121], additional\ncolor reconnections among parton fragments [122], or by including enhanced feed-down\n\n31\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nfrom higher-mass charm-baryon states within a statistical hadronization approach [123],\nwhere the higher-mass excited charm-baryon states are predicted by the Relativistic Quark\nModel [124], but not yet measured.\n\nFigure 2.16: TheD+\nS /D\n\n0 (top) and Λ+\nc /D\n\n0 (bottom) ratios measured in pp collisions at\n√\ns\n\n= 13 TeV for different multiplicity classes at mid- (left) and forward (right) rapidity [112].\n\nThe ALICE Collaboration recently conducted a multiplicity-differential study of the\nΛ+\n\nc /D\n0 and D+\n\nS /D\n0 cross-section ratios as shown in Fig. 2.16. The results confirm my\n\nprevious studies of the multiplicity-dependece of the charm-baryon ratios [125] and it\nopens up an interesting research area for the multiplicity-dependent study of excited charm\nstates. In Chapter 7, I present my work aimed at the understanding of the underlying\nmechanisms of charm baryon fragmentation.\n\n2.7 Event Activity and the Underlying Event\nHadron collisions are highly complex and it is far from obvious how to study specific\nparticle processes while excluding the background processes that occur during a collision\n(see illustration in Fig. 2.17, taken from [126]). The process of interest is typically a single\nparton–parton scattering process at very high transverse momentum (pT) transfer, while\nthe background consists of the remnants of the colliding hadrons that did not participate in\n\n32\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nthe hard scattering, including the products of additional soft, multiple-parton interactions.\nUnderstanding this background contribution is crucial for all physics measurements in the\nLHC, let that be the study of quark-gluon plasma, Higgs physics or beyond the Standard\nModel searches, or to increase the precision of our physics measurements, especially at\nhigh pT.\n\nThe properties of the underlying event currently cannot be derived from first principles\nin QCD, but there are experimental techniques to measure the underlying event contribu-\ntion by using event classifiers. One example is the average charged-particle multiplicity\nmeasured in the transverse plane, i.e. in the region of phase space orthogonal to the high-\npT process. In this section I define the underlying event and discuss the observables that\nprovide a quantitative description.\n\nFigure 2.17: Illustration of proton–proton collision with UE included, that leads to a final\nstate consisting of a Z boson and a hard jet.\n\n2.7.1 Underlying Event\n\nThe underlying event (UE) was first defined by the CDF collaboration in 2002 [127]. The\nunderlying event consists of all the secondary processes, as well as beam remnants. The\nUE is usually treated as independent from the leading hard process [128], and it is usually\nmeasured in the region far away from the jets. Understanding the UE has been essential\nin order to understand the background in measurements of hard probes. More recent defi-\nnitions of the UE also include events with multiple jets [129]. In recent years, differential\nmeasurements came into focus that characterize the UE not only as a background compo-\n\n33\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nnent, but in terms of its relation to the leading process. This way processes that connect\nthe soft and hard regimes of a collision, such as multi-parton interactions, can be explored.\n\n2.7.2 Classification of Events\n\nInsight into the connection of hard processes and the underlying event can be gained by\nthe differential exploration of events with respect to event-shape variables.\n\nEvent Multiplicity Variables\n\nTraditionally the final-state (event) multiplicityNch is used to categorize events by activity,\ndefined as the number of all charged final state particles in the event in the mid-rapidity\nacceptance. Since Nch is defined in the same pseudorapidity range as where the charmed-\nhadron yields are computed from, effects observed via Nch may be influenced by autocor-\nrelation. Therefore we also used the forward multiplicity Nfw, which we defined as the\nnumber of charged particles within the acceptance 2 < |η| < 5.\n\nWe characterize the event with event-activity classifiers that are selectively sensitive\nto the activity in the underlying-event or to that caused by high-momentum jets in the\nleading process. One such observable is the transverse event-activity classifier RT ≡\nN trans\n\nch /〈N trans\nch 〉 [130], where N trans\n\nch is the charged-hadron multiplicity in the transverse\nregion defined the following way. The charged final-state hadron with the highest trans-\nverse momentum within the acceptance (the trigger hadron) is selected and the event is\naccepted only if the trigger hadron has a transverse momentum ptrig\n\nT > 5 GeV/c. N trans\nch is\n\nthen the number of charged final-state hadrons in the transverse side, defined with the az-\nimuth angle relative to the trigger hadron as π\n\n3\n< |∆φ| < 2π\n\n3\nwithin |η| < 1. Since the trig-\n\nger hadron most likely comes from a high-momentum jet initiated by the leading process,\nand the recoil jet is expected to show up at the opposite side, N transverse\n\nch is dominated by\nhadrons from the underlying event [131]. In models such as PYTHIA that describe events\nin terms of MPI, RT is strongly correlated with the number of MPIs in an event [130].\nAnalogously, we defined the near-side cone activity RNC ≡ Nnear-side cone\n\nch /〈Nnear-side cone\nch 〉\n\nin a narrow cone around the trigger particle,\n√\n\n∆φ2 + ∆η2 < 0.5. As this region is dom-\ninated by the fragments of the jet containing the trigger particle, RNC will be primarily\ndetermined by the multiplicity of the jet initiated by the leading hard process. In Fig. 2.18\n(taken from [131]) we show an illustration of the toward, away, and transverse regions in\nthe azimuthal plane, with respect to the leading particle direction.\n\n34\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.18: Schematic picture of the toward, away, and transverse regions in the az-\nimuthal plane, with respect to the leading particle direction.\n\nTransverse Spherocity\n\nEvent classification based on RT and RNC requires a high-transverse-momentum trigger,\nand thus it restricts the analysis to events containing a hard process. This introduces a\nbias into the sample and makes it more difficult to accumulate sufficient statistics in an\nexperimental environment. A similar event selection may however be achieved based\non the geometrical shape of the event. One such variable is transverse spherocity [132],\ndefined as\n\nS0 ≡\nπ\n\n4\nmin\nn̂\n\n(∑\ni |pT,i × n̂|∑\n\ni pT,i\n\n)\n, (2.20)\n\nwhere i runs over all the particles in the acceptance and n̂ is any unit vector in the azimuth\nplane. The transverse spherocity characterizes the events by jettiness in the azimuthal\nplane, and it is defined between 0 and 1 by construction: for isotropic events S0 approaches\nunity, and for events determined by collimated clusters of final-state particles, S0 is close\nto zero. In Fig. 2.19 (taken from [133]), I show an illustration of the transverse spherocity\nS0 describing jetty and isotropic events in the transverse plane.\n\n35\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.19: Schematic picture of the spherocity S0 showing jetty and isotropic events in\nthe transverse plane.\n\nFlattenicity\n\nThe transverse spherocity S0 concentrates on the central η range and therefore it is not\nsensitive to the part of event which expands toward higher η. A new event classifier has\nbeen proposed recently to overcome this limitation, the so-called flattenicity [134], which\nsimilarly to the spherocity, provides information about the ”jettiness” of an event and does\nnot require a trigger. This event quantifier is capable of selecting hedgehog-like events\nwithout a characteristic jetty structure in high-multiplicity pp collisions. Not requiring a\ntrigger particle is also advantageous to gain a better statistics, as we do not have to exclude\nso many events from the analysis.\n\nThe flattenicity ρ is calculated by splitting up the η-φ plane of an event into equal-\nsized rectangles, and the average transverse momenta of the particles inside the rectangles\nis taken. Then the flattenicity is simply the relative standard deviation of the average\nmomentum inside the rectangles according to the formula\n\nρ =\nσpcellT\n\n〈pcell\nT 〉\n\n, (2.21)\n\nwhere σpcellT\nis the deviation, while the 〈pcell\n\nT 〉 is the average of the transverse momenta.\nFlattenicity has been successfully utilized to classify events corresponding to the under-\nlying physics process [135–137]. As an illustration, Fig. 2.20 (taken from [134]) shows\n\n36\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\ntwo events with significantly different flattenicity values. As clearly visible, the event with\nlower ρ value is much more isotropic, while the other one with higher ρ is overall more\n”jetty”.\n\nFigure 2.20: Example of two PYTHIA 8.244 events with Monash tune, one with low flat-\ntenicity (left) and the other with high flattenicity (right). The event with lower flattenicity\nlooks significantly more isotropic.\n\n2.7.3 KNO Scaling\n\nFinal-state multiplicities in small colliding systems are known to follow a negative bino-\nmial distribution (NBD) regardless of the exact type of colliding particles over several\norders of magnitude of energy ranges [138–140]. Koba, Nielsen and Olesen demonstrated\nthat the event multiplicity distributions can be all collapsed onto a universal scaling curve,\nthis is the Koba–Nielsen–Olesen (KNO) scaling [141, 142]. It has been observed in e+e−\n\ncollisions that the multiplicity distributions at different collision energies can indeed be\ncollapsed into a single distribution, however, found to be violated at higher energies and\nin more complex, hadronic collision systems [143, 144]. In Fig. 2.21 [145, 146], the KNO\nscaling is shown in experimental data of e+e− and pp collisions. Neither the origin of\nthe scaling, nor the reason for its breakdown is yet completely understood, although many\nexplanations have been proposed in the past decades [147–151].\n\nAt higher center-of-mass energies, where the average final-state multiplicity is higher,\nsemi-hard vacuum-QCD effects such as multiple-parton interactions (MPI) play a signif-\nicant role. Multiple works proposed that the scaling violation may be caused by these\neffects. A scenario based on the Lund string model [145, 152] proposes that the overlap-\nping color strings break the scaling. Another work argues that underlying-event activity\nlinked to MPI with color reconnection (CR) is responsible for the violation of the scal-\ning [153]. The are earlier works also proposed that the KNO scaling may be a property of\nthe jet itself [154].\n\nAt lower collision energies, since events with jet events have very little background,\ncollision energy can be directly linked to average pjet\n\nT . This suggests that pjet\nT may be a\n\nmore fundamental scaling variable, and the violation may be explained by the breaking-\ndown of the connection of\n\n√\ns to the average pjet\n\nT toward higher energies as well as more\ncomplex colliding systems.\n\n37\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nFigure 2.21: Example for the KNO scaling in experimental data where the multiplicity\ndistributions have been normalized with the average both for electron-positron collisions\n(left) and proton–proton collisions (right).\n\n2.8 Experimental Facilities\nTo create QCD matter for the investigation of its properties, we use powerful accelerators\nto collide particles into each other. Presently, there are two primary facilities dedicated\nto heavy-ion physics: the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Switzerland, and\nthe Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the\nUnited States. Additionally, a major new facility, the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), is under\nconstruction. Its primary goal will be to explore the properties of gluons.\n\n2.8.1 The Large Hadron Collider\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world’s largest and most powerful particle ac-\ncelerator. It first started up in 2008, and still remains the latest addition to the CERN\naccelerator complex. The LHC consists of a ring of superconducting magnets with a cir-\ncumference of 27-kilometer, together with a number of accelerating structures to boost the\nenergy of the particles along the beam pipe.\n\nInside the accelerator’s beam pipes, two high-energy particle beams travel at nearly\nthe speed of light, in opposite directions in separate beam pipes, both tubes kept at ultra-\nhigh vacuum. They are guided around the accelerator ring by a strong magnetic field\n\n38\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nmaintained by superconducting electromagnets, conducting electricity without resistance\nor loss of energy. To maintain the superconducting state, the electromagnets must be kept\nat a temperature of −271.3◦, colder than outer space. To achieve this, the accelerator is\nconnected to a distribution system of liquid helium.\n\nThousands of magnets of various types and sizes are used to direct the beams around\nthe accelerator, including 1232 dipole magnets (15 meters in length) which bend the\nbeams, and the 392 quadrupole magnets (each 5–7 metres long), that focus the particle\nbeams. Another type of magnet is used to squeeze the particles inside the beams closer\ntogether, to increase the chances of a collision between two particles.\n\nAll the controls for the accelerator, its services and technical infrastructure are housed\nunder one roof at the CERN Control Centre. From here, the beams inside the LHC are\nmade to collide at four locations around the accelerator ring, corresponding to the positions\nof the four big particle detector systems: ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb. An illustration\nof the CERN accelerator complex is shown in Fig. 2.22.\n\nFigure 2.22: The CERN accelerator complex, layout in 2022 [155].\n\n39\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n2.8.2 The ALICE Detector\n\nThe ALICE detector is specifically designed for studying the strongly interacting matter\nformed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions [77]. The experiment carries out a compre-\nhensive study of the hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in these collisions,\nto unravel the properties of the quark-gluon plasma, which is formed in these extreme\nconditions (see Sec. 2.5). ALICE also studies pp and p–A collisions both as a compari-\nson with A–A collisions and in their own right. In 2021, ALICE completed a significant\nupgrade of its detectors to further enhance its capabilities for the data collection period of\nRun 3 and 4, which is planned to be finished at the end of 2032. At the same time, up-\ngrade plans are being made for ALICE 3, a next-generation experiment for data collection\nperiods of Run 5 and 6 [107]. The experimental results presented in Chap. 5 and Chap. 6\nare based on data collected by the ALICE experiment. In the following I briefly describe\nthe ALICE detector system. More detailed information on its setup and performance can\nbe found in Refs. [156, 157].\n\nThe ALICE apparatus consists of a central barrel, covering the pseudorapidity region\n|η| < 0.9, a muon spectrometer with a −4 < η < −2.5 coverage, and both forward- and\nbackward-pseudorapidity detectors employed for triggering, background rejection, and\nevent characterization. The central-barrel detectors used in the analyses covered in this\nthesis are the Inner Tracking System (ITS), the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), and the\nelectromagnetic calorimeters (EMCal and DCal). They are embedded in a large solenoid\nmagnet which provides a maximum magnetic field of B = 0.5 T parallel to the beam\ndirection, in order to bend the tracks of charged particles for charge and momentum deter-\nmination.\n\nInner Tracking System\n\nHeavy-flavor hadrons decay weakly and have a long lifetime. The mean lifetime for charm\nhadrons is τc ≈ 150 µm and τb ≈ 400 µm for beauty hadrons, therefore the position of\ntheir decay (the secondary vertex) will be displaced from the position of the collision\n(primary vertex). One key task of the ITS [158] is to locate the primary vertex with a\nprecision of a tenth of a millimeter. Another functions of the ITS are the reconstruction of\nthe secondary vertices from the decays of D and B mesons and hyperons, the tracking and\nidentification of particles with momentum below 200 MeV/c, and improving the angle and\nmomentum resolution for particles reconstructed by the TPC. It consists of six layers of\nsilicon detectors, with the innermost two composed of Silicon Pixel Detectors (SPD).\n\n40\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\nTime Projection Chamber\n\nThe TPC [159] is the main particle tracking detector of the central barrel. It is a 90m3\n\ngaseous chamber capable of three-dimensional reconstruction of charged-particle tracks.\nThe detection is based on the charged particles ionizing the gas atoms along the path\nthey travel inside the gas of the TPC. The liberated electrons then drift towards the end\nplates of the detector where they are detected. The TPC measures the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) of charged particles in the detector gas. The particles can then be identified using\nthe Bethe-Bloch formula, which describes the average energy loss of charged particles\nthrough inelastic Coulomb collisions with the atomic electrons of a medium.\n\nElectromagnetic Calorimeter\n\nThe EMCal and DCal detectors [160, 161] are shashlik-type sampling calorimeters con-\nsisting of alternate layers of lead absorber and scintillator material. The EMCal covers\nranges of |η| < 0.7 in pseudorapidity and ∆ϕ = 107◦ (80◦ < ϕ < 187◦) in azimuth. The\nDCal is located azimuthally opposite the EMCal, with a coverage of 0.22 < |η| < 0.7 and\n∆ϕ = 60◦ (260◦ < ϕ < 320◦) and |η| < 0.7 and ∆ϕ = 7◦ (320◦ < ϕ < 327◦). The\nEMCal and DCal are part of the same detector system, used for electron identification.\n\nV0 Detector\n\nThe V0 detector, consisting of two scintillator arrays [162], placed on each side of the\ninteraction point (with pseudorapidity coverage 2.8 < η < 5.1 and −3.7 < η < −1.7)\nare utilized for triggering and offline rejection of beam-induced background events. The\nminimum bias trigger is defined requiring coincident signals in both scintillator arrays of\nthe V0 detector. In p–Pb collisions, the contamination from beam-induced background\ninteractions and electromagnetic interactions can be further removed with the information\nof the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) [163], located along the beam line at 112.5 m on\nboth sides of the interaction point. A T0 detector [164], composed of two arrays of quartz\nCherenkov counters, covering an acceptance of 4.6 < η < 4.9 and −3.3 < η < −3.0, is\nemployed to determine the luminosity together with the V0 detector.\n\nThe schematics of the ALICE detector is shown in Fig. 2.23 for the Run 2 data taking\nperiod, corresponding to the data analyses in Chapters 5 and 6.\n\n41\n\n\n\nChapter 2 – High-energy Hadron Collisions\n\n1\n2\n\n14\n\n1718\n\n18\n17\n\n13\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n8 9\n\n1212\n12\n\n1211\n\n15\n\n16\n\n6\n\n7\n\n10\n\n19THE ALICE DETECTOR\n\nITS\nFMD, T0, V0\nTPC\nTRD\nTOF\nHMPID\nEMCal\nDCal\nPHOS, CPV\nL3 Magnet\nAbsorber\nMuon Tracker\nMuon Wall\nMuon Trigger\nDipole Magnet\nPMD\nAD\nZDC\nACORDE\n\nITS SPD (Pixel)\nITS SDD (Drift)\nITS SSD (Strip)\nV0 and T0\nFMD\n\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\ne.\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14,\n15.\n16,\n17.\n18.\n19.\n\nFigure 2.23: Schematics of the ALICE detector during Run 2 [165].\n\n42\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nMultiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nJet profile measurements in hadron colliders have long been suggested as sensitive probes\nof QCD parton splitting and showering calculations [166–168], and even as an indicator\nof the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [168]. A recent study suggests to verify a possible ex-\nistence of a QGP-droplet by measuring properties of jets in association with a Z-boson\nin ultra-central pp collisions [169]. Another suggestion is to measure the structures of\nphoton-tagged recoil jets in comparison to inclusive jet. This would allow for the detailed\nunderstanding of the color-charge effect in fragmentation as well as the elimination of\nsurface bias in jet quenching [170]. In experiment, jet structure observables with full jet\nreconstruction have been studied in different collisional systems at HERA, the Tevatron,\nand the LHC [42, 171–177], among others. Gaining a detailed understanding of the mul-\ntiplicity dependence of jet structures up to high momenta is particularly important with\nthe recent advent of machine learning classification techniques in jet studies. These tech-\nniques rely heavily on modeling parton shower and fragmentation, and their connection to\nthe underlying event and avoiding possible selection biases is essential [178, 179].\n\nIn this analysis I extensively studied the multiplicity-dependent jet shapes with the\nPYTHIA 8 event generator [12], using different tunes and setups to examine the possible\neffects of multiple-parton interactions (MPI) on jets. I provide predictions for pp collisions\nat\n√\ns = 7 TeV to motivate similar, multiplicity-dependent jet structure measurements at\n\nthe LHC. In models with string hadronization, the recombination of overlapping color\nstrings (color reconnection or CR) influence fragmentation and are also known to produce\ncollective-like patterns such as radial flow [180]. I investigate the effects caused by the\nchoice of the CR scheme within PYTHIA on the simulated jet structures. As a reference\npoint in my investigations, I decided to use a set of jet structure measurements by the CMS\nexperiment at\n\n√\ns = 7 TeV, carried out in a wide jet momentum range from 15 GeV/c\n\nup to 1000 GeV/c [42]. A previous CMS study investigated multiplicity-differential jet\nstructures, albeit momentum-inclusively with a pjet\n\nT > 5 GeV/c jet transverse momentum\nthreshold, to understand the influence of the underlying event (UE) on jets [177].\n\n43\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nThis chapter is organized as follows. In Section 3.1, I describe the analysis method\nin detail. In Section 3.2, I present the event multiplicity distributions and discuss the\ndifferential and integral jet shape measurements. The observation of a characteristic jet\nsize is also presented, and a double ratio of differential jet shapes is proposed to measure\nthe effects of multiplicity. Finally, I summarize my results in Section 3.3.\n\n3.1 Analysis Method\nI used the PYTHIA 8.226 [12] event generator to generate random pp collisions at a center-\nof-mass energy of\n\n√\ns= 7 TeV. I allowed any hard pQCD process, but in order to decrease\n\nsimulation time I limited the phase space by requiring a certain minimum invariant trans-\nverse momentum p̂T of the hardest 2→ 2 process in an event.\n\nI selected p̂T > 5 GeV/c, p̂T > 20 GeV/c, p̂T > 40 GeV/c and p̂T > 80 GeV/c\n\nfor the evaluation of jets with pjet\nT > 15 GeV/c, pjet\n\nT > 50 GeV/c, pjet\nT > 80 GeV/c, and\n\npjet\nT > 125 GeV/c, respectively. These cutoffs were determined so that they do not have\n\ninfluence on the shape of the reconstructed pjet\nT spectrum.\n\nI simulated 5 million events for each setting. Besides the default tune Monash 2013\n(Monash), I investigated two others, the MonashStar and 4C tunes (see Sec. 2.3.1). Using\nthe Monash tune as a starting point I also did investigations where I changed some set-\ntings in PYTHIA to directly study their effect on the jet structure. There are continuously\ndeveloped models of multiple-parton interactions implemented in PYTHIA [181, 182]. To\nunderstand the multiplicity-dependent jet modification by MPI, I used data samples where\nI switched this effect on and off.\n\nI also studied the different color reconnection schemes provided by PYTHIA, including\nturning off this feature completely. Color reconnection is a built-in mechanism in PYTHIA\n\nthat allows interactions between partons originating in MPI and initial/final state radia-\ntions, by minimizing color string length. Since this procedure is quite ambiguous, several\nmodels are implemented. The original MPI-based scheme used in PYTHIA 8.226 (that I\ndenote CR0 in the followings) relies on the parton shower-like configuration of the beam\nremnant. In an additional step, it merges the gluons of a lower-pT MPI system with gluons\nof a higher-pT MPI system. A newer QCD-based scheme [122] (CR1) relies, however,\non the full QCD color configuration in the beam remnant. Then the color reconnection\nis made by minimizing the potential string energy. The QCD color rules are incorporated\nin the CR to determine the probability that a reconnection is allowed. This model also\nallows the creation of junction structures. Besides the above-mentioned CR schemes, a\nso-called gluon move scheme [183] (CR2) has been implemented to PYTHIA recently, in\nwhich gluons can be moved from one location to another so as to reduce the total string\nlength.\n\n44\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nI carried out a full jet reconstruction including both charged and neutral particles, using\nthree popular algorithms, the anti-kT [40], kT [38, 184], and Cambridge-Aachen [39, 185]\nalgorithms, provided by the FASTJET [41] software package. All of them are sequential\nclustering algorithms, meaning that the closest particle tracks in momentum space are\nsequentially merged one-by-one according to the minimum of a distance measure between\nthe particle four-momenta. While all three algorithms are infrared and collinear safe, in\nhigh-multiplicity environments the clusterization outcomes will be rather different. Anti-\nkT is popular because it is only slightly susceptible to pile-up and underlying events, and it\nclusterizes hard jets into nearly perfect cones with a resolution parameter R even in high-\nmultiplicity events, in accordance with the general image of how a jet should look like.\nThe other two algorithms are more suitable for jet substructure studies but provide jets of\nirregular shape that are not uniform in area, especially the kT algorithm, where the area of\nthe jets fluctuates considerably [41].\n\nSimilarly to the CMS analysis [42, 177], I selected inclusive jets, with a resolution pa-\nrameter R = 0.7. I considered constituent particles, with a transverse momentum thresh-\nold |pT,track|> 0.15 GeV/c, at the generator level. My experience matches earlier findings\nthat the detector effects, after corrections, do not change the simulated jet observables sig-\nnificantly [42]. I examined jets in the pseudorapidity window |ηjet| < 1 and restricted\nmy investigations to the 15 GeV/c < pjet\n\nT < 400 GeV/c jet momentum range, where\nmultiplicity-differential studies are feasible in the near future.\n\nFor the investigation of a possible jet shape modification I analyze the transverse mo-\nmentum profile of the jets as in [42]. As a first step I showed that my simulations reproduce\nCMS data [42] within uncertainty throughout this range. I show examples in three differ-\nent pjet\n\nT windows in Fig. 3.3. For harder jets, the calculated momentum density distribution\ngets steeper in the central (small-r) region of the jets, in qualitative accordance with the\ncalculations of [168].\n\nI investigate the jet structure for different charged hadron multiplicity (Nch) classes.\nGenerally, PYTHIA is known to reproduce multiplicities in LHC data with little differences\nover a broad pT range. Charged hadron multiplicities at mid-rapidity are well reproduced\nby the 4C tune except for a slight discrepancy at very high Nch values [177].\n\nThe CUETP8M1 and Z2∗ tunes reproduce pion and kaon average pT versus track mul-\ntiplicities within errors [186]. The D6T and Z2 tunes show a marginal agreement with the\nCMS jet-multiplicity data, with about 5% higher predictions than the mean values, flat in\npT [42]. I use charged hadron multiplicity at mid-rapidity (referred to as multiplicity in\nthe followings for the sake of simplicity), defined as the number of the charged final state\nparticles with |η| < 1 in a given event.\n\nAs my main focus, I carry out a detailed study on the multiplicity dependence of ρ, but\nI also use Ψ evaluated at fixed radii as it allows for easier experimental comparison.\n\n45\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\n3.2 Results\nIn this section I present my results and consider the physical implications. As a first step I\ncompute ρ(r) similarly to Fig. 3.3, but this time I divide up the data into two multiplicity\nclasses, Nch ≤ 50 and 50 < Nch, respectively. We see a multiplicity dependence in the jet\nshapes in Fig. 3.4. Namely, the jets contain a higher fraction of their transverse momentum\ncloser to their axis and a lower fraction further away from their axis in the case of low\nmultiplicity. For high multiplicity the jet shape behaves in the opposite way. This is\na trivial, expected multiplicity dependence arising from two reasons. The first one is that\nevent multiplicity is correlated with jet multiplicity, resulting in a higher fraction of narrow\njets in low-Nch events. The second reason is the UE background, which affects the jet\nstructure more at higher r values, and its effect is stronger in the case of high-Nch events.\n\n3.2.1 Event-multiplicity Distributions\n\nI show the multiplicity distributions in Fig. 3.1 for the jet momentum window 110 GeV/c\n\n< pjet\nT < 125 GeV/c as an example. As shown in the left panel, distributions of the multi-\n\nplicity are very similar for the different tunes. However, when considering the multiplicity\ndistribution from different settings of the Monash tune, shown on the right panel, a sub-\nstantial difference can be seen between the settings with and without MPI or CR. Disabling\nMPI (and CR, which assumes MPI) causes the distribution to shift toward lower values,\nwhile keeping a similar shape.\n\nDisabling CR only, on the other hand, causes the multiplicity distribution to extend\ntoward higher values. This means that care should be taken when one compares distribu-\ntions with MPI or CR settings on and off, as it may be biased when the chosen multiplicity\nclass is too wide. I note that multiplicity distributions from different color reconnection\nschemes do not differ significantly.\n\nThe pjet\nT dependence of the mean and RMS values of the multiplicity distribution is\n\ncompared in Fig. 3.2 for different tunes, as well as for different settings in the case of the\nMonash tune. The three tunes predict very similar mean and RMS values throughout the\npjet\n\nT range. While the means of the 4C and Monash tunes overlap, MonashStar predicts\nslightly lower multiplicities.\n\nThe pjet\nT dependence of multiplicity distributions is a key observable for validating\n\nthe strength of multiple-parton interaction and color reconnection effects in Monte Carlo\nmodels, as both MPI and CR have a grave effect on the distributions. Switching off MPI\ncauses a downward shift of about 15 to 25 in mean Nch at any pjet\n\nT , or almost a factor of\nthree at lower pjet\n\nT values, while switching off CR alone causes a somewhat less drastic\nincrease of about 10 to 20 in mean Nch counts. The three examined color reconnection\nmodels provide very similar distributions except for lower pjet\n\nT values, where the gluon-\nmoving CR scheme predicts slightly narrower multiplicity distributions and a somewhat\n\n46\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nlower mean value.\n\nFigure 3.1: Event-multiplicity distributions for jets in the 110 GeV/c < pjet\nT < 125 GeV/c\n\nwindow, compared for the Monash, MonashStar, and 4C tunes (left) and for the Monash\ntune with CR0, CR1 and CR2 settings applied, as well as both CR and MPI turned off\n(right).\n\nFigure 3.2: Mean and RMS values of the event-multiplicity distributions as a function of\nthe pjet\n\nT , compared for different tunes (left) and settings (right). The uncertainties of the\nmean and RMS values are comparable to the symbol size.\n\n47\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\n3.2.2 Differential Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.3: Differential jet shape ρ(r) for different PYTHIA tunes compared to measure-\nments of CMS experiment in pp collisions at\n\n√\ns = 7 TeV [42], for 20 GeV/c < pjet\n\nT < 25\nGeV/c (left), 50 GeV/c < pjet\n\nT < 60 GeV/c (center) and 110 GeV/c < pjet\nT < 125 GeV/c\n\n(right).\n\nMeasurements by the CMS experiment [177] that compare five multiplicity classes\nwithin the range 10 < Nch ≤ 140 and reconstruct jets at momenta pjet\n\nT > 5 GeV/c saw\na remarkable difference between low- and high-multiplicity ρ(r) for low r values. The\nsame is observed for relatively low pjet\n\nT values (3.4 left panel). Dividing ρ(r) for both the\nhigh- and low-multiplicity classes with the multiplicity-integrated ρMI(r) (no condition\non Nch), shown in Fig. 3.5, highlights this trend. The curves are much more apart for\nlow r values at small pjet\n\nT , while there is relatively little difference between different pjet\nT\n\nwindows for high r values. This suggests that jets in high-multiplicity events contain much\nmore contribution from the soft regime, and soft physics is selected by a choice of lower\nmomentum range.\n\nJets in low-multiplicity events are on average narrower than in high-multiplicity events,\nhence the corresponding ρMI(r) ratio is above unity, while for high-multiplicity events this\nratio is below unity. At high r values, where UE tracks give a non-negligible contribution\nespecially in the high-multiplicity events, the situation is just the opposite. In between,\nthere is a point at a given r value where the two curves intersect each other at unity,\nmeaning that the jets are just average at that radius. In Fig. 3.5, we see three examples in\ndifferent pjet\n\nT windows and we can observe that the intersection point has a jet-momentum\ndependence.\n\nThis is not unexpected since harder jets are narrower and UE is significant already at\nsmaller radii. To have a closer look at this behavior, I evaluate ρMI(r) in a more refined\ndivision of data with seven multiplicity classes in the range 1 ≤ Nch ≤ 250. We find\nthat the curves intersect unity at virtually the same location for a given pjet\n\nT value. This\nstatement holds even if we compare different PYTHIA tunes and MPI or CR settings, as\n\n48\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.4: Comparing the differential jet shape ρ(r) of multiplicity-integrated (black),\nlow-multiplicity (Nch ≤ 50, red), and high-multiplicity (Nch > 50, green) events, for 20\nGeV/c < pjet\n\nT < 25 GeV/c (left), 50 GeV/c < pjet\nT < 60 GeV/c (center) and 110 GeV/c\n\n< pjet\nT < 125 GeV/c (right).\n\nshown on the examples in Fig. 3.6 for the Monash and 4C tunes as well as the Monash\ntune without color reconnection.\n\nFigure 3.5: Ratio ρ(r)/ρMI(r) of differential jet shape in low-multiplicity (Nch ≤ 50, red)\nand high-multiplicity events (Nch > 50, green) over multiplicity-integrated events, for 20\nGeV/c < pjet\n\nT < 25 GeV/c (left), 50 GeV/c < pjet\nT < 60 GeV/c (center) and 110 GeV/c\n\n< pjet\nT < 125 GeV/c (right).\n\n3.2.3 Characteristic Jet Size\n\nIn the left and center panels of Fig. 3.7, the r dependence of the intersection radius is\nplotted with respect to the jet transverse momentum for different tunes, as well as for\nthe different settings of the Monash tune. The intersection radius is computed using a\nlinear interpolation between the two nearest points of ρ(r)/ρMI(r), and its uncertainty is\nestimated by taking both the high- and the low-multiplicity classes, moving the points to\nthe upper and lower edge of their error bars in both cases, and determining the maximum\n\n49\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.6: Ratio ρ(r)/ρMI(r) of differential jet shapes in several multiplicity classes over\nmultiplicity integrated events, for 110 GeV/c < pjet\n\nT < 125 GeV/c. The panels show\nevents generated using the Monash tune (left), the 4C tune (center), and the Monash tune\nwithout CR (right).\n\nand minimum values of the intersection radius from these cases. We observe that for all\ntunes and settings that I tested, the intersection radii are consistent within uncertainties for\nany chosen pjet\n\nT value. There is additional uncertainty on the obtained intersection radius\nstemming from the linear interpolation between finite, δr = 0.1 wide bins. In order to\nestimate this, I repeated the analysis with the three tunes in r = 0.05 wide bins. While\nthe statistical fluctuations increase, the points move a maximum of 4% upwards or 28%\n\ndownwards in a strongly correlated manner (see Fig. 3.7).\nNevertheless, the overall shape of the curves remains very similar and statistically\n\nconsistent between different tunes point-by-point. Therefore, I suggest that the intersection\nradius rch = r|ρ=ρMI\n\nbe considered as a characteristic jet size measure specific for a given\njet transverse momentum. I note that this quantity was first referred to as Rfix in my\npublication [187], but it should not be compared to the jet resolution parameter R, which\nis typically chosen so that most of the jet momentum is contained within the radius R. In\ncontrast, rch is defined as a radius where the momentum density of the jet from events of\nany multiplicity is just like in the average jet, and substantial fraction of jet momentum\nfalls toward smaller as well as toward larger radii.\n\nJet shapes depend on the jet reconstruction algorithm, so I investigated whether the\nobserved stability of the intersection radius can be an artifact of the jet reconstruction\nalgorithm itself. Besides the anti-kT algorithm which I first utilized, I have reprocessed all\nthe data with using the kT and the Cambridge-Aachen algorithms. There is no significant\ndifference beyond the statistics-driven fluctuations between data reconstructed by different\nclusterization algorithms in any of the tunes or MPI/CR settings. In the right panel of\nFig. 3.7, I show a comparison of rch(pjet\n\nT ) for the Monash tune with the three different jet\nreconstruction algorithms.\n\n50\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.7: Evolution of the characteristic radius rch as a function of pjet\nT , for several\n\nPYTHIA tunes (left), settings (center), and jet reconstruction algorithms for the Monash\ntune (right). The absolute uncertainty arising from the choice of bin width is indicated by\nthe yellow shaded band.\n\nJets are more collimated with increasing transverse momentum. In a simple picture this\ncan be linked to applying a Lorentz boost, i.e., to the momentum of the initiating parton\nin the laboratory system. The pjet\n\nT -dependent evolution of rch may also be explained by\nLorentz-boosted high-pT jets (see the illustration in the left panel of Fig. 3.8).\n\nIn order to gain an effect-level understanding, I use a simplistic model. I consider\nparticles radiating from a point in a plane with momenta of equal absolute value p0. I\nboost these particles along the axis perpendicular to their plane, with a certain momentum\npboost. The resulting particles will form a cone around the boost axis in the lab system,\nrepresenting our “jet”. In the right panel of Fig. 3.8, we see that the resulting size of the\n“jet”, Rcone, depends on pboost in a qualitatively similar manner to how the intersection ra-\ndius rch depends on pjet\n\nT . This attests to the assumption that the universal behavior can, at\nleast partially, be understood by the narrowing by Lorentz-boost of high-pT jets. It is to be\nnoted, however, that this model is a simplistic treatment of jet narrowing, and therefore an\nexact agreement is not expected. A proper description requires a perturbative QCD-based\napproach where the narrowing is a consequence of the running of the strong coupling con-\nstant αs with kT [166–168]. Since there is no angular cut-off that would limit the jet sizes\nat low momenta, Rcone is allowed to blow up at low pboost values. Also, one cannot expect\nreal jets to go below a certain size because after certain point the clustering algorithms will\nbe driven by the presence of the UE. This may explain the apparent convergence of the rch\n\ncurves to a finite value at high pT. As mentioned before, rch at high-pT is also influenced\nby the choice of δr. A particularly interesting question is whether rch can be generalized\nto the larger and more complex systems produced in heavy-ion collisions. To see that, one\nwould need to do simulations in heavy-ion collisions and verify the outcome with data. In\ncase rch is representative of the jet size in heavy-ion collisions, it would provide a handy\nobservable for the exploration of medium modification of jets.\n\n51\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.8: Illustration of the jet cone narrowing by Lorentz boost (left). Evolution of cone\nradius based on a simplistic boosted cone model for different p0 assumptions (right).\n\n3.2.4 Momentum Fractions\n\nIn Fig. 3.9, the integral jet shape is plotted as a function of the multiplicity, at high mo-\nmenta within 180 GeV/c < pjet\n\nT < 200 GeV/c. In the left panel, where tunes are com-\npared, there is no observable effect in the integral structure between the tunes Monash,\nMonashStar, and 4C. I present the effects of different MPI and CR settings on the integral\njet structure in the right panel of Fig. 3.9. Different color reconnection schemes do not\nlead to significant differences, but there is a slight deviation at high Nch values when color\nreconnection is turned off. However, the lack of MPI causes a significant difference within\nthe same multiplicity class, that grows approximately linearly with Nch, which suggests\nthat the MPI has a strong influence on the jet structure, especially at high Nch values. It is\nto be noted that the effect is less significant in case of lower pjet\n\nT windows and in case of\nlarger r values.\n\nAt lower multiplicities, MPI and CR cause little difference in the integrated jet shape.\nThe Ψ(r) values at highNch are lower in the case when MPI is turned off, meaning that the\njets are more concentrated in a narrow cone. This can be understood by a higher relative\nfraction of soft tracks coming from the UE in case when there is no MPI, compared to\nthe MPI case with the same multiplicity where there is a more relevant contribution from\ntracks which come from the jet itself. Note that the points in Fig. 3.9 are not at the bin\ncenters, but they are placed to represent the weight of theNch distribution in a given bin, to\neliminate the possible bias stemming from different Nch distributions within multiplicity\nclasses.\n\n52\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nUnderstanding the observed dependence of the integrated jet structure on the multi-\nplicity needs further analysis supported by experimental data. The above observation, if\ncompared to real data, may provide a control over the extent of MPI effects. Further stud-\nies are needed to identify MPI/CR effects and separate them from the UE, also using other\nobservables that are less sensitive to the UE.\n\nFigure 3.9: Evolution of the integral jet shape Ψ(r = 0.2) as a function of the event\nmultiplicity Nch within 180 GeV/c < pjet\n\nT < 200 GeV/c, with a jet resolution parameter\nR = 0.7. Several PYTHIA tunes (left) and settings (right) are compared. The points are\nplaced according to the weight of the distribution in each multiplicity class.\n\n3.2.5 Double Ratio of Momentum Densities\n\nIn Fig. 3.10 the differential jet structure for various PYTHIA tunes is plotted in a particular\npjet\n\nT window to compare them in the low- and high-multiplicity regions. In the right panel\nof Fig. 3.10, I take the differential jet shapes for the above-mentioned low- and high-\nmultiplicity classes and divide them with each other to highlight the differences for the\ndifferent tunes. As expected, jets in low-multiplicity events have a more steeply falling\nmomentum density distribution than the ones in high-multiplicity events, which is also\nreflected in a falling ratio. However, there are also certain significant differences between\nthe selected tunes that are beyond this trivial effect.\n\nTo highlight the differences between the jet structures from different tunes, I compute\nthe double ratio\n\nDR(r) =\nρlow/ρhigh\n\n(ρlow/ρhigh)ref.tune\n\n, (3.1)\n\nwhere I divide the former ratio of the high- and low-multiplicity classes with the very same\n\n53\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nratio calculated for the Monash tune. After the trivial effect is gone, a rather sizable effect\nin the order of a factor of 2 can be seen for both the 4C and the MonashStar tunes, with\nrespect to the Monash as the reference tune. The right panel of Fig. 3.11 shows the same\ncalculations for the 4C tune, for several different choices of high- and low-multiplicity\nclass pairs. In this selected pjet\n\nT range all of them show similar structures, and generally the\neffect is larger when the separation in multiplicity is larger. It is very important to note that\nthese curves are derived from statistically independent samples, hence cannot be explained\nby fluctuations. Since on Fig. 3.10 and 3.11 I calculate ratios of binned data without a bin\ncenter correction, I tested its possible effect by decreasing the bin size from δr = 0.1 to\nδr = 0.05. I did not find any difference beyond statistical uncertainties.\n\nFigure 3.10: Differential jet shape using several PYTHIA tunes, for 110 GeV/c < pjet\nT\n\n< 125 GeV/c. The jet shapes from low-multiplicity events (Nch ≤ 25, left) are compared\nto high-multiplicity events (100 < Nch ≤ 250, center), and their ratio computed (right).\n\nIn order to understand the dependence of the effect on pjet\nT , one might wish to describe\n\nthe deviations for each pjet\nT value with a single number. Therefore I computed the squared\n\nsum of the bin-by-bin deviations of the double ratio from the Monash tune, i.e.,\n\nRSD =\n\n√ ∑\n0<ri<r\n\n(DR(ri)− 1)2 (3.2)\n\nat a given pjet\nT . In Fig. 3.12, I show the results for different tunes as well as for different\n\nselections of multiplicity class pairs. Again, we see a rather parallel behavior of the 4C\nand MonashStar tunes (in other words, the Monash tune is the one that deviates from these\ntwo). The behavior versus pjet\n\nT is nontrivial with several minima and maxima, and is not\neasily explained without taking into account peculiar details of each tune. However, one\nsees again a very strong correlation between curves of different multiplicity selections\ncalculated independently from each other, and that the amplitude strongly depends on the\nseparation between the low- and high-multiplicity classes. Thus we can conclude that the\nmultiplicity-dependent analysis of jet structures in a wide pjet\n\nT range has the potential of\n\n54\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.11: The double ratio with Monash as reference tune plotted (left).

The HIJING++ was selected for this purpose because it im-\nplements a mechanism for creating the underlying event and QCD effects on the soft-hard\nboundary that is different from PYTHIA (see Section 2.3.2). HIJING++ uses the PYTHIA\n\njet fragmentation, therefore we do not expect any difference during the later stages. In-\nstead of MPI as implemented in PYTHIA, HIJING++ uses minijet production. Differences\nat lower momenta may arise below the minijet cutoff. In case of the transverse momentum\nand multiplicity distributions, these effects do not exceed the variation caused by applying\ndifferent tunes in PYTHIA.\n\nIn Fig. 3.13, I show the evolution of the characteristic jet size as a function of pjet\nT using\n\nHIJING++, and compare it to the PYTHIA results. In case of HIJING++, the analysis was\ndone using two different PDF sets to observe if there is any difference in the conclusions.\nThe results show quantitatively the same characteristic jet size dependence on pjet\n\nT within\nsystematic errors.\n\n55\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.12: Square sum of the bins in the DR(r) − 1 diagram for the 4C (green) and\nMonashStar (red) tunes with respect to the Monash reference tune, depending on the pjet\n\nT ,\nfor 0 < Nch ≤ 25 as low-multiplicity, and 80 < Nch ≤ 100 as high-multiplicity selections\n(left). Square sum of the bins in the DR(r) − 1 diagram for the 4C tunes with respect to\nthe Monash reference tune, depending on the pjet\n\nT , for various low- and high-multiplicity\nselections, as listed in the legend. (The pjet\n\nT range is restricted to omit parts with large\nfluctuations.)\n\n3.2.7 Heavy-flavor Jet Shapes\n\nJets originating from different flavors undergo different fragmentation due to both the\ncolor-charge effect and the dead-cone effect [188]. Therefore, I compared flavor-inclusive\njets to heavy-flavor (beauty and charm) jets in the study of jet shapes. It was ensured that\nheavy flavor comes from the initial stages by only enabling leading order processes in\nPYTHIA. I also made a comparison to flavor-inclusive jets that contain only leading and\nsubleading jets.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the effect of selecting only the leading and subleading jets\nfrom events is negligible on the characteristic jet size (see left panel of Fig. 3.14). Although\nthe overall tendency for heavy-flavor is similar to that observed for light flavor, there is also\na clear quantitative difference between heavy and light flavors, which points to a different\njet structure. The leading beauty jets differ for higher pjet\n\nT and the leading charm jets for\nlower pjet\n\nT . This suggests that the interplay between the mass and color-charge effects is\nnon-trivial and needs further investigation. One possibility for that would be a parallel\nstudy of the UE and the fragmentation region corresponding to a heavy-flavor trigger, in a\nsimilar manner to [153]. From all the above, we can assume that the characteristic jet size\nis a property of the jets that is associated with the final state.\n\n56\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.13: Evolution of the characteristic radius rch as a function of pjet\nT for PYTHIA\n\n4C and for HIJING++ with two different PDFs. The absolute uncertainty arising from the\nchoice of bin width is indicated by the yellow shaded band.\n\nIn the right panel of Fig. 3.14, I plotted the integral jet structure at r = 0.2 for heavy-\nflavor jets. Here we can observe that heavy-flavor jets are narrower than inclusive jets on\nthe average. This clearly shows that multiplicity-differential jet structures are sensitive to\nflavor-dependent fragmentation. However, the effect is interestingly not ordered by mass,\nsince the beauty Ψ(r = 0.2, Nch) curve is between the inclusive and the light jets. It is also\nto be noted that the ordering is pjet\n\nT -dependent, with a similar trend as the one observed for\nthe characteristic jet size.\n\n3.3 Summary\n\nI performed a novel jet shape analysis in\n√\ns = 7 TeV pp collisions to explore the multi-\n\nplicity and pjet\nT -dependence of differential and integrated jet structure observables. I used\n\nseveral models implemented in the PYTHIA 8.226 event generator. I demonstrated that the\nsimulations describe CMS data, and I gave predictions for the jet structure observables in\nseveral multiplicity classes, over a wide momentum range. I found that there is a given\nradius rch where jet momentum density is independent of multiplicity. This radius is insen-\nsitive to the choice of simulation settings (choice of tune, presence, and modelling of MPI\nand CR) within the investigated model class and even of jet clustering algorithms, and its\npT-dependence qualitatively follows a Lorentz-boost curve. These observations suggest\n\n57\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\nFigure 3.14: The evolution of the characteristic jet size as a function of pjet\nT (left) and\n\nthe integral jet structure at r = 0.2 (right) for both heavy-flavor and inclusive jets. The\nabsolute uncertainty arising from the choice of bin width is indicated by the yellow shaded\nband in the left panel.\n\nthat rch is an inherent property of jets that is characteristic to the spatial development of\nthe parton shower at a given momentum.\n\nI compared the multiplicity dependence of jet structure variables for three popular\nPYTHIA tunes as well as different MPI and CR models in several pT bins. I found that the\nevolution of the differential jet structure ρ(r) with multiplicity significantly differs in sev-\neral pjet\n\nT ranges for the Monash, MonashStar, and 4C tunes. The shape of the difference is\nnontrivial in pjet\n\nT , but persistent through all tested choices of multiplicity selections. With\nthis I demonstrated that the multiplicity-dependent analysis of jet momentum profiles can\ndifferentiate among otherwise well-established models. This lack of understanding may\nhave grave consequences on studies based on classification by jet properties. My obser-\nvation highlights the need of extending multiplicity-dependent jet structure measurements\nsuch as in [177] to higher pjet\n\nT regimes. I also performed a cross-check analysis with\nHIJING++, using two different PDF sets, which confirmed that the characteristic jet size\nwas not a peculiarity in PYTHIA. These observations suggest that the characteric jet size\nis an inherent property of the jets and is characteristic to the space-time evolution of the\nparton shower at a given momentum.\n\nHowever, the characteristic jet size does depend on the jet flavor. Flavor-dependent jet\nstructure studies may be a way to access mass versus color charge effects that is compli-\nmentary to hadron- or jet-production cross-section measurements. My findings motivate\nfurther phenomenology studies as well as cross-checks with real data to gain a deeper un-\nderstanding of flavor-dependent jet fragmentation. Another direction for future research\n\n58\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Multiplicity Dependence of Jet Shapes\n\ncould be to investigate the effects of MPI on jets without the underlying event. This could\nbe done either by choosing an observable that depends very weakly on the underlying\nevent [189], or by both understanding the underlying event and the fragmentation re-\ngion [153]. Finally, we also saw that the integrated jet structure variable Ψ(r = 0.2)\n\nshows a rather different Nch-dependence when MPI are turned off. This attests to the im-\nportant role of multiple-parton interactions in higher multiplicity events and the need for\ntheir detailed understanding in order to develop accurate models in jet physics.\n\n59\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nScaling Properties of Jet Structures\n\nIn this chapter I present a study on the scaling properties of event multiplicity distributions\nin proton–proton collisions. First, I introduce the KNO scaling which involves the scaling\nof the event multiplicity distributions with the collision energy, then I present my mea-\nsurements on a similar scaling phenomenon, simply referred to as ”KNO-like scaling”, in\nwhich the jet multiplicity distributions scale with the jet transverse momentum.\n\n4.1 KNO-like Scaling in Jets\nAs we discussed in Section 2.7.3, the Koba–Nielsen–Olesen (KNO) scaling [141, 142]\nis the collapse of the final-state event multiplicity distributions onto a universal scaling\ncurve. In a recent study, based on proton–proton collision data I simulated, it was found\nthat a KNO-like scaling may be fulfilled within single jets [190]. This indicates that the\nKNO scaling is violated by complex quantum-chromodynamics (QCD) processes outside\nthe jet development, such as single and double-parton scatterings or softer multiple-parton\ninteractions (MPI).\n\nIn this section I present my study of the scaling properties of heavy-flavor (HF) jets\ncompared to an inclusive jet sample. Heavy flavor is mostly produced in hard (large\nmomentum-transfer) processes, in the early stages of the collision event. The most relevant\nperturbative QCD processes that contribute to the production cross section are leading-\norder (LO) flavor creation, and next-to-leading order (NLO) gluon splitting as well as fla-\nvor excitation [71]. The parton shower and fragmentation of heavy-flavor jets is different\nfrom light-flavor jets due to two main reasons: the color charge effect, i.e. heavy flavor jets\nare initiated by quarks as opposed to light-flavor jets that are mostly gluon-initiated [191];\nand the dead-cone effect, meaning that small-angle gluon radiations off a massive parton\nare forbidden in QCD, and as a consequence, heavy-flavor fragmentation is harder and\nresults in different jet substructures [35, 36, 192, 193].\n\n60\n\n\n\nChapter 4 – Scaling Properties of Jet Structures\n\nIn this study I modeled both light and heavy-flavor jets using the PYTHIA 8 Monte\nCarlo event generator [12], and differentiated the jet samples according to the process\nby which they were created. Whether a KNO-like scaling observed for inclusive jets is\nretained or violated in heavy-flavor jets, can shed light on the origin of the scaling itself.\nIt can also provide information on the possible mechanisms which are responsible for\nthe violation of the scaling in heavy-flavor jets. The methods I present in this chapter\ncan further be used to gain insight into the flavor-dependent evolution of jets. Future\nmeasurements targeted on the scaling of light and heavy-flavor jets can also serve as a\nvalidation tool for heavy-flavor production and fragmentation models.\n\n4.2 Analysis Method\n\nI simulated proton–proton collisions at\n√\ns = 7 TeV center-of-mass energy utilizing the\n\nPYTHIA 8 (version 8.226) event generator with the Monash tune and HardQCD set-\ntings [12, 194]. PYTHIA 8 is tuned to describe both the fundamental physical observables\nof the leading hard process and the underlying event, and it is known to reproduce final-\nstate multiplicities well [177, 186]. In PYTHIA 8 the hard parton scatterings and decays\nare simulated using LO matrix elements (ME). These are amended by initial and final state\nradiations, which create the parton shower (PS) in perturbative QCD calculations based\non Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) splitting kernels [12], as well as\nsoft and hard multiple-parton interactions integrated into a single framework [181]. The\nhadronic final state is then produced with the Lund string fragmentation model [195].\n\nUsing the option in PYTHIA 8 to restrict event generation to certain hard processes,\nsimilarly as it was described in Sec. 3.1, I created four different datasets. As the baseline\nfor my study, I created an inclusive-jet sample, in which any hard QCD scattering process\nwas allowed above an appropriately selected value of the minimal momentum transfer in\nthe hardest process (p̂T), depending on the jet transverse momentum (pjet\n\nT ), as detailed\nin [187]. As a next step, I created samples with ME flavor creation, where hard 2 → 2\n\nparton scatterings were allowed only with heavy-flavor outgoing partons: gg → bb̄(cc̄) and\nqq̄ → bb̄(cc̄). This provided wide-angle heavy-flavor jets created directly in the leading\nprocess of the event. Finally, I created a sample that is dominated by beauty jets from\nthe PS, by allowing only those 2 → 2 processes that do not directly create heavy flavor:\ngg → gg, gg → qq̄, qg → qg, qq̄ → gg, qq̄ → q′q̄′ (where incoming heavy flavor is\nallowed, but only light flavor exits), and finally three more processes: qq̄′ → qq′, qq̄′ → qq̄′\n\nand q̄q̄′ → q̄q̄′ (where outgoing and incoming flavors are the same and q and q′ may be of\nthe same flavor) [196]. In this case the heavy quark pair is produced in a later step, e.g. in\na g → bb̄ gluon splitting process, typically with smaller opening angles. The heavy quarks\nthen often manifest in the final state as secondary jets besides the leading jet, or may even\nend up in the same jet.\n\n61\n\n\n\nChapter 4 – Scaling Properties of Jet Structures\n\nIn all cases, charged-particle jets were clusterized from final-state charged pions, kaons\nand (anti)protons with pT > 0.15 GeV/c using the anti-kT jet-clustering algorithm [40]\nwith a resolution parameter of R = 0.7 in the mid-rapidity range |η| < 1 and full az-\nimuth coverage. The reconstructed jets were categorized in 20 different pjet\n\nT ranges, from\n15 GeV/c up to 400 GeV/c. In the case of the charm and beauty jet samples, the corre-\nsponding heavy quark was required to fall within the cone of the selected jet, similarly to\njet-tagging methods that are utilized in experiments [92, 197].\n\n4.3 Results\nIn Fig. 4.1, I plot the mean and the root mean square (RMS) values of the event multiplic-\nity (Nch) distributions at central pseudorapidity (|η| < 1), as a function of pjet\n\nT , separately\nfor inclusive jets, beauty jets and charm jets from ME flavor creation as well as for beauty\njets from parton shower processes. As one expects, events having jets with a higher pjet\n\nT\n\ncontain more final-state hadrons on the average, and the distribution also gets broader to-\nward higher pjet\n\nT . Heavy-flavor jets from ME flavor creation correspond to a lower average\nmultiplicity at a given pjet\n\nT , while heavy-flavor from the parton shower follows the trend of\ninclusive jets. The difference is especially prominent for higher pjet\n\nT .\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nM\ne\n\na\nn\n\n m\nu\n\nlt\nip\n\nlic\nit\ny\n\n=7 TeVsPYTHIA8 pp \n\nInclusive jets\nc­jet ME prod.\n\nb­jet ME prod.\nb­jet PS prod.\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n (GeV/c)\n\njet\n\nT\ntransverse momentum p\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n25\n\nR\nM\n\nS\n\nFigure 4.1: The mean (top panel) and RMS values (bottom panel) of the charged-hadron\nmultiplicity distributions at |η| < 1 for inclusive jets, for charm and beauty jets from\nME-level production as well as for beauty jets from production in the PS, as a function of\npjet\n\nT .\n\n62\n\n\n\nChapter 4 – Scaling Properties of Jet Structures\n\nAs a next step, I fitted the multiplicity distributions with a negative binomial distribu-\ntion (NBD) function in each of the jet transverse momentum ranges,\n\nPNch\n=\n\nΓ(Nchk + a)\n\nΓ(a)Γ(Nchk + 1)\npNchk(1− p)a, (4.1)\n\nwhere a, k and p are parameters related to the mean and dispersion of the distribution of the\nmultiplicity Nch. In Fig. 4.2, I show the multiplicity distributions after all the pjet\n\nT ranges\nhave been scaled on top of each other using the NBD fits. The scaling approximately holds\nfor all four jet samples which I investigated. However, for jets containing charm or beauty\nfrom flavor creation, the data show minor departures from the NBD fits: the distribution is\nwider for larger pjet\n\nT , while narrower for smaller pjet\nT values.\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\n3−10\n\n2−10\n\n1−10\n\n1\n\ns\nc\na\nle\n\nd\n d\n\ne\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\n=7 TeVsPYTHIA8 pp \n\ninclusive jets\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n (GeV/c)\n\njet\n\nT\np\n\n15 ­ 20\n20 ­ 25\n25 ­ 30\n30 ­ 40\n40 ­ 50\n50 ­ 60\n60 ­ 70\n70 ­ 80\n80 ­ 90\n90 ­ 100\n100 ­ 110\n110 ­ 125\n125 ­ 140\n140 ­ 160\n160 ­ 180\n180 ­ 200\n200 ­ 225\n225 ­ 250\n250 ­ 300\n300 ­ 400\n\nc­jet ME prod.\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\nscaled multiplicity\n\n3−10\n\n2−10\n\n1−10\n\n1\n\ns\nc\na\nle\n\nd\n d\n\ne\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\nb­jet ME prod.\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\nscaled multiplicity\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nNBD fit\n\nb­jet PS prod.\n\nFigure 4.2: Charged-hadron multiplicity distributions with an NBD fit at |η| < 1, for all\npjet\n\nT ranges, scaled by the NBD fit means. The four panels from top left to bottom right\ncorrespond to inclusive jets, charm and beauty jets from ME flavor creation, and beauty\njets from PS production.\n\n63\n\n\n\nChapter 4 – Scaling Properties of Jet Structures\n\nTo quantify the deviations from the scaling behavior, and also to mitigate the effect of\nfluctuations, I calculated the higher moments of the multiplicity distributions in a similar\nmanner to [190]. Here the qth moment in a given pjet\n\nT window is defined as\n\n〈N q\nch〉 =\n\n+∞∑\nNch=1\n\nPNch\nN q\n\nch, (4.2)\n\nwhere PNch\nis the probability distribution corresponding to the event multiplicity Nch. If\n\nthe scaling is fulfilled and the mean of the distribution scales with a factor λ, then it is\nexpected that the qth moment scales with λq as\n\n〈N q\nch(pjet\n\nT )〉 = λq(pjet\nT )〈N q\n\nch(p0)〉, (4.3)\n\nwhere p0 is chosen so that the scaling factor is λ(p0) = 1.\nIn Fig. 4.3, I plotted on a log-log scale the first nine statistical moments of the mul-\n\ntiplicity distributions divided by the order q, as a function of the mean charged-hadron\nmultiplicity 〈Nch〉 at |η| < 1. The four panels correspond to the four jet categories. The\nlinear fits show a similar trend for all four cases, which means that the scaling is present\nalso for heavy-flavor jets.\n\nFig. 4.4 summarizes the slopes of the fits for the first nine statistical moments, as well\nas the goodness-of-fit parameter χ2/NDF. All slopes are around unity within ≈5%. As\nexpected, the goodness of the linear fits is worse for higher moments. The beauty jets\ncoming from parton shower processes follow the same trend as the inclusive jets. On the\nother hand, heavy-flavor jets coming from matrix element production in the simulations\ncorrespond to slope parameters that are slightly but significantly different from unity: for\ncharm jets, slopes of the fits for moments 2 ≤ q ≤ 6 tend to be lower than unity, while\nfor beauty jets the slopes for moments q ≥ 7 are larger than unity. Furthermore, the good-\nness of the fits for heavy-flavor ME production tends to be worse than for inclusive jets,\nχ2/NDF ≥ 10 for any q ≥ 5. This suggests that the KNO-like scaling originates from the\nhard parton production, and it is less influenced by the parton shower. The similar patterns\nof the inclusive jets and the beauty jets from PS also indicate that event multiplicities are\nnot driven by flavor-dependent jet fragmentation processes.\n\n4.4 Summary\nIn this section I summarize my results on the scaling properties of heavy-flavor jets from\ndifferent production processes, and compare them to those of inclusive jets.

The distributions are normalized by their order q on a\nlog-log scale, and linear fits are applied.\n\nI found that the multiplicity distributions satisfy a KNO-like scaling with pjet\nT for charm\n\nand beauty jets similarly to what has been observed for inclusive jets. I note, however, that\nmultiplicity distributions in events with jets initiated by charm and beauty directly from the\nleading hard process show some departure from the negative binomial shape, depending on\nthe pjet\n\nT . Further analysis of the statistical moments of the multiplicity distributions shows\nthat the scaling is fulfilled within≈5% throughout the full pjet\n\nT range, but the deviations are\nmore significant for leading-order heavy flavor creation, especially in the case of beauty.\nOn the other hand, beauty production from the parton shower tends to deviate less from\nscaling expectations and follows the inclusive-jet trend within uncertainties. I conclude\ntherefore that the KNO-like scaling originates from the parton level of the early stages of\n\n65\n\n\n\nChapter 4 – Scaling Properties of Jet Structures\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0.92\n\n0.94\n\n0.96\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n1.04\n\n1.06\n\n1.08\n\n1.1\n\ng\nra\n\nd\nie\n\nn\nt \no\nf \nfi\nt\n\nInclusive jets\nc­jet ME prod.\n\nb­jet ME prod.\nb­jet PS prod.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\norder of moment (q)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n/N\nD\n\nF\n2\n\nχ\n\nFigure 4.4: The slope parameters (top panel) and the goodness-of-fit parameters χ2/NDF\n(bottom panel) of the linear fits for the first nine statistical moments of the multiplicity\ndistributions, for charm and beauty jets from ME production and beauty jets from PS\nproduction, compared to that for inclusive jets, as a function of the order of moments of\nthe multiplicity distributions.\n\nthe collision, and not from the later stages of parton shower or jet fragmentation.\nA good description of hadron multiplicity distributions is a basic requirement for mod-\n\nels and it is generally fulfilled by the most widely used event generators. However, multi-\nplicities as a function of the jet momentum for jets tagged with different flavors can provide\nmeans to further validate heavy-flavor production and fragmentation models. Also, while\nevent multiplicity is a good proxy for jet multiplicity in case of jets coming from the lead-\ning hard process, this is not necessarily the case for jets that come from secondary hard\nprocesses or gluon radiation. An interesting extension of the current work in this direction\nis therefore to evaluate the scaling in terms of the jet multiplicity instead of the event mul-\ntiplicity, and to see whether in that case the scaling of heavy flavor jets from the parton\nshower follows light or heavy jets.\n\n66\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nJet Multiplicity Distributions in pp\nCollisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\nAs we discussed in Section 2.7.3, the Koba–Nielsen–Olesen (KNO) scaling [141, 142],\ni.e. the collapse of the final-state event multiplicity distributions onto a universal scaling\ncurve, was first proposed to be present in collision events, but was later found to be violated\nbeyond a certain energy threshold and also in hadronic collision systems [143, 144]. In\nSection 4, I presented my research on the KNO-like scaling in proton–proton collisions\nutilizing PYTHIA 8 simulations.\n\nNeither the origin of the KNO scaling, nor the mechanism that violates it is yet com-\npletely understood, although several scenarios have been suggested [147–151, 198]. A\nrecent study based on proton–proton collision data that I simulated found a KNO-like\nscaling within the jets, and concluded that the KNO scaling is violated by processes out-\nside the jet development such as single and double-parton scatterings or softer multiple-\nparton interactions [190]. In a later simulation study, which I presented in Chapter 4,\nI used heavy-flavor jets to show that the KNO-like scaling originates from the partonic\nlevel [193]. These findings, however, are not yet confirmed experimentally.\n\nIn this chapter I present the first measurement of the jet multiplicity distributions as\na function of jet transverse momentum in pp collisions at\n\n√\ns = 13 TeV in the ALICE\n\nexperiment. I also present the first time measurement of the KNO-like scaling of the\nmeasured jet multiplicity distributions. The results will allow for the verification of intra-\njet KNO-like scaling or for the observation of its violation.\n\nThe KNO scaling within jets further brings up a lot of interesting questions regarding\nthe hadronization and fragmentation processes: What is the exact origin of the scaling?\nHow does it depend on the collision system or the parton the jet originates from? and\nmany more... In this data analysis I hope to provide valuable information to help answer\nthese questions and to motivate future research.\n\n67\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\n5.1 Experimental Setup and Data Sets\nA complete description of the ALICE experimental setup and its performance can be found\nin [156, 157], and a detailed description was given in Sec. 2.8.2. For particle tracking\nand identification, the ALICE central barrel detectors located within a solenoid magnet\n(B = 0 .5 T) were used. These include the Inner Tracking System (ITS), the Time Pro-\njection Chamber (TPC), and the Time-Of-Flight detector (TOF). The ITS tracks charged\nparticles within the pseudorapidity interval |η| < 0.9 and also helps in the primary and\nsecondary vertex reconstruction. The TPC is the main tracking device. The V0 scintillat-\ning detector covers the ranges of −3.7 < η < −1.7 and 2.8 < η < 5.1 and is used for\nthe online trigger and offline event selection. A minimum-bias (MB) trigger was used to\ncollect the data sample, requiring a signal above a given threshold in both V0 counters.\nEvents were selected offline, using the timing information from the V0 with the correla-\ntion between the number of hits and track segments in the first two layers of the ITS, to\nremove beam-gas interactions. Only events with a primary vertex reconstructed within\n±10 cm from the center of the detector along the beamline were used for the analysis.\nThe analysed data sample consists of about 1.7 billion minimum-bias events from pp col-\nlisions at\n\n√\ns = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of Lint = 22.55 nb−1,\n\ncollected during the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Monte Carlo samples are ALICE\nGEANT3 MC simulations with pp events generated by PYTHIA 8 using Monash tune.\nThese MC samples are pthard-binned jet-jet productions anchored to the 2016, 2017 and\n2018 datasets.\n\n5.2 Analysis Method\nThe analysis procedure is briefly the following. I extract the jet multiplicity distributions\nas a function of the jet transverse momenta, so that I can investigate whether the KNO-like\nscaling holds (as in Chapter 4), i.e. the jet multiplicity distributions can be all collapsed\nonto a universal scaling curve. Before the multiplicity distributions are fitted for the scal-\ning, I correct them for the detector effects (called unfolding), and calculate the systematic\nuncertainties. The unfolded multiplicity distributions with the systematic errors are then\ninvestigated for the scaling by a fitting procedure. I present these steps in the remainder of\nthis chapter.\n\n5.2.1 Event and Track Selection\n\nFor my analysis minimum bias events were selected by the ALICE MB trigger, which\nrequires coincidence in the V0A and V0C detectors. Events are accepted only if the vertex\nposition on the beam-axis falls within (|zvertex| < 10 cm) of the nominal interaction point\n(IP), as can be seen in Fig. 5.1.\n\n68\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\nTracks are only accepted if they fall within ALICE acceptance, i.e. if they satisfy the\n|ηtrk| < 0.9 and pT > 0.15 GeV/c constraints.

The\nminimum charged track pT is 0.15 GeV/c, and the track acceptance is within the TPC\nacceptance (|η| < 0.9 and 0 < φ < 2π). The pjet\n\nT range is between 5 GeV/c and 140\nGeV/c, and the jets must be contained inside the fiducial acceptance of the TPC (|η| < 0.5\n\nand 0 < φ < 2π), i.e. the jet axis is at least an R distance away from the edges of the\nTPC. In Fig. 5.7 and Fig. 5.8, I present the control plots for the most important kinematic\ndistributions of the reconstructed jets.\n\n72\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n)c (GeV/\n\nT,jet\np\n\n1\n\n10\n\n210\n\n310\n\n410\n\n510\n\n610\n\n710\n\nc\no\n\nu\nn\n\nts\n = 13 TeVspp \n\nALICE this thesis\n\nFigure 5.7: The pT distribution of jets.\n\n1− 0.8− 0.6− 0.4− 0.2− 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\njet\nη\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n310×\n\nc\no\n\nu\nn\n\nts\n\n = 13 TeVspp \nALICE this thesis\n\nFigure 5.8: The η distribution of jets.\n\n73\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\n5.3 Unfolding\nMeasured data is influenced by effects such as detector resolution, inefficiencies and noise\nas well as background fluctuations, that smear the distributions of the observed physical\nvariables. To correct for these effects, we use the so-called unfolding technique [199]. We\nuse simulations to understand the smearing effects. First, ”particle level” or ”generator\nlevel” samples are produced as the output of Monte Carlo event generators. The generator-\nlevel samples are then fed into the GEANT 3 detector and simulation tool [200]. Then a\nresponse matrix is constructed, which is used in a deconvolution process to obtain the\ntrue physical distributions from the measured ones. I use the RooUnfold package [201]\nimplemented in the ALICE analysis framework to do a 2-dimensional unfolding using the\nBayesian method [202] in order to obtain the truth-level jet multiplicity distributions as a\nfunction of pjet\n\nT .\n\n5.3.1 Response Matrix\n\nMy analysis uses a 2D unfolding, which requires the construction of a 4D response matrix.\nThis matrix was filled with the observablesN reco\n\nch , pjet,reco\nT ,N true\n\nch , pjet,true\nT , and the following\n\nbins were used:\n\n• Detector level jet pT bins: {40, 55, 70, 85, 95, 105, 115, 125, 140} GeV\n\n• Detector level Nch bins: {6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24}\n\n• Particle level jet pT bins: {25, 40, 55, 70, 85, 95, 105, 115, 125, 140, 200} GeV\n\n• Particle level Nch bins: {4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 50}\n\nSince, as described in Sec. 4, the extracted jet multiplicity distributions have to be fitted\nwith an NBD curve to investivate their scaling properties, we need a fine enough binning in\nthe jet multiplicities. On the other hand, as it will be shown in the closure test (Sec.5.3.4),\nthe statistics are low for high multiplicity jets in the low pjet\n\nT region, and similarly, statistics\nare low for the low multiplicity jets in the high pjet\n\nT region. Consequently, I cannot use the\nvery low pjet\n\nT regions to extract the multiplicity distributions for the physics, and I also\nlimit the analysis to pjet\n\nT < 140 GeV/c. In Fig. 5.9 I show the 2D distributions of the pjet\nT\n\nand in Fig. 5.10 the jet multiplicity for the particle and detector levels, respectively.\nAfter the simultaneous unfolding of the jet multiplicity Nch and jet transverse momen-\n\ntum pT, Bayesian unfolding was chosen and carried out with the help of the RooUnfold\npackage. I perform various checks on the unfolding procedure, including Monte Carlo\nclosure test: a validation technique that ensures that known simulated samples are repro-\nduced after applying the detector effects and then the unfolding procedure. The relevant\nchecks are outlined in the next few sections.\n\n74\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\nFigure 5.9: The 2D response matrix for detector and particle level pjet\nT values.\n\nFigure 5.10: The 2D response matrix for detector and particle level jet multiplicity values.\n\n75\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\n5.3.2 Convergence\n\nThe first unfolding check is the convergence with the number of iterations. The unfolded\ndata at each number of iterations is compared to the distribution at the next iteration to en-\nsure that the results converge and do not vary significantly after iterating a certain number\nof times. I found that the unfolded 2D distribution already converges well after 3 itera-\ntions, as it is shown in Fig. 5.11, and the optimal choice of the number of iterations was\nfound to be 3 iterations.\n\n1.00289 1.00322 1.01873 0.996972 0.905457 0.920336 1.02058 1.08147\n\n1.00076 1.00161 1.01657 1.00159 0.936846 0.871687 1.09337 1.05162\n\n1.00149 1.00029 0.977265 0.974861 1.00834 1.06364 0.892531 0.958776\n\n1.00413 1.00288 0.996367 1.02175 0.978676 0.9492 1.02452 0.98164\n\n0.999079 1.00535 0.987649 1.01148 1.0386 0.990442 1.06224 1.02755\n\n0.997824 0.996532 0.979747 1.00605 0.97742 0.976988 1.02465 1.0472\n\n1.00098 0.99875 1.00095 1.01867 1.00985 0.970776 0.964289 0.998445\n\n1.0052 0.999418 0.995764 1.01402 1.05242 0.979927 1.01285 0.981361\n\n0.997602 1.00539 0.980584 0.98492 1.03601 0.980472 1.01117 1.02505\n\n1.03279 0.996833 1.01388 0.979402 1.01154 0.942318 0.970019 1.0226\n\n1.04582 0.9835 1.03086 1.0125 0.970388 0.99051 0.93819 0.986016\n\n1.11028 1.02506 1.01529 1.03486 0.96057 1.02057 1.03883 1.00979\n\n40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\njet\n\nT\np\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nje\nt\n\nc\nh\n\nN\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\n1.1 = 13 TeVspp \nALICE this thesis\n\nFigure 5.11: To check the convergence of the unfolding, I calculate the ratios of the un-\nfolded 2D distributions at the 3rd and 4th iterations.\n\n5.3.3 Refolding Test\n\nThe unfolded data is smeared with the response matrix and compared to the original raw\ndata to check the mathematical consistency of the unfolding process.

An important closure test to check the unfolding procedure is\nthe so-called split closure test where the MC sample is split such that 80% fills a response\nmatrix and 20% fills a pseudo-data distribution with corresponding pseudo-true distribu-\ntion. The pseudo-data is then unfolded as if it was real data, and the result is compared\nto its underlying prior or the pseudo-true distribution. In Fig. 5.15 and Fig. 5.16 I show\nthe pseudo-data and pseudo-true distributions that we gain after the splitting of the Monte\nCarlo samples.\n\n78\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\nFigure 5.15: The pseudo-data distribution. The distribution was used for the split closure\ncheck.\n\nFigure 5.16: The pseudo-true distribution. The distribution was used for the split closure\ncheck.\n\nIn Fig. 5.17 I show the result of the split closure check, in which I compared the un-\nfolded pseudo-data to the pseudo-true distribution. The comparison is done by calculating\nand plotting their ratio for each bin. The statistics for high-multiplicity jets at low jet pT is\nlow, similarly the statistics of low-multiplicity jets for higher jet pT is also low.\n\n79\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\nThis results in the closure check not producing good results for these bins. Since these\nbins are not relevant for the physics that we want to do (i.e. extracting the jet multiplicity\ndistributions and fit them), I instead make sure that the closure is good for the relevant\nregions.\n\nFigure 5.17: The ratio of the unfolded 2D pseudo-data and the pseudo-true distributions.\nIn the regions which are relevant to the physics (i.e. where the jet multiplicity distributions\nare extracted from), the closure check works well.\n\n5.4 Systematic Uncertainties\nThe unfolded jet-multiplicity distributions need to be complemented with the systematic\nuncertainties that affect the measurement. In the following I summarize the different\nsources and quantify the systematic errors.\n\nThe most significant contribution to the overall systematic error is the tracking effi-\nciency uncertainty. For the hybrid track selection, the uncertainty on the efficiency was\nquantified to be 3%. To estimate the impact at the level of the observables, I degraded\nthe detector-level PYTHIA events by randomly rejecting an extra 3% of the tracks, then\nrepeated the jet reconstruction process on this new MC particle sample and the reconstruc-\ntion of the response matrix. I then unfolded the jet-multiplicity distributions with this new\nresponse matrix instead of the nominal response, and the difference between this result\nand the nominal unfolded result, obtained with the nominal tracking efficiency, was used\nto assign a systematic uncertainty to the data.\n\n80\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\nAnother source of systematic error is coming from the choice of regularization. The\nunfolded result calculated with 1 iteration up and 1 iteration down from the nominal one is\ncompared to the nominal distribution, and the difference was taken as the systematic error.\n\nThe unfolding process requires a binning choice in the detector and particle level dis-\ntributions. I varied the bin boundaries randomly by 5%, while leaving the edges the same.\nThe resulting jet-multiplicity distributions were compared to the nominal one, and the\ndifference was taken as the systematic error.\n\nFinally, the last significant source of systematic error comes from the choice of the\nprior distribution. The prior represents our initial beliefs about the true distribution of a\nvariable before considering observed data. The initial MC distributions were reweighted\nand smoothed out as the new choice of prior for the unfolding process. The resulting new\nunfolded distributions were compare to the nominal distribution and the difference was\ntaken to be the systematic error. In Fig. 5.18 the total systematic errors, coming from all\nthe mentioned sources, were plotted.\n\n5.5 KNO-like Scaling in the Unfolded Jet Multiplicity Dis-\ntributions\n\nI performed a two-dimensional measurement of the jet multiplicity as a function of pjet\nT . I\n\ncorrected the extracted jet multiplicity distributions for detector effects and projected the\ndistributions for specific pjet\n\nT ranges (see Sec. 5.3), so I can fit them with an NBD curve and\ninvestigate the presence of the KNO-like scaling. In Fig. 5.19, I plot the scaled multiplicity\ndistributions and show that they indeed can be collapsed onto a universal NBD distribution.\n\nIn Fig. 5.20, I present the first nine statistical moments of the unfolded jet-multiplicity\ndistributions, calculated similarly as it was done in my simulation analysis [193]. The\nstatistical errors are large for the higher pjet\n\nT ranges, but we can still make a linear fit. To\nmake the gradients more visible, similarly as in Chapter 4, the gradients are plotted sepa-\nrately for the first nine moments in Fig. 5.21. There is an approximately 20% discrepancy\ntoward higher statistical moments. This might indicate that the KNO-like scaling was seen\nin simulations only because of the specific multiplicity distributions of the particular ap-\nplied model, or that the experimentally investigated energy range is not high enough. It\nis to be noted however, that the current data is not completely corrected: the background\nsubtraction is yet to be implemented. This may influence the observed multiplicity distri-\nbutions.\n\n81\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Jet Multiplicity Distributions in pp Collisions at the ALICE Experiment\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\njet\n\nchN\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n S\n\ny\nte\n\nm\na\nti\nc\n U\n\nn\nc\ne\nrt\n\na\nin\n\nti\ne\ns\n\nSystematic Errors\n\nTotal Sys.

My main contribution\n\nto the analysis was the creation of detailed simulations in PYTHIA 8, which were used to\ncompare the near- and away-side peaks of the azimuthal-correlation distributions in both\npp and p–Pb collisions to the model predictions. I determined the correlation peak shapes\nusing FONLL pQCD calculations for the modelling of charm and beauty contributions.\n\nThe correlation distributions in this analysis were measured for associated charged\nparticles in the range 1 < passoc\n\nT < 7 GeV/c and trigger electrons originating from heavy-\nflavor hadron decays in the range 4 < pe\n\nT < 12 GeV/c. The used associate particle pT\n\nrange is significantly higher compared to previously published measurements of D-meson\ncorrelations with charged particles [94, 95], and the measurements were also compared\nwith Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with different event generators: PYTHIA 6 [203] and\nPYTHIA 8 [204], HERWIG [14, 205], EPOS [206, 207], and POWHEG coupled with\nPYTHIA 6 for the parton shower and hadronization (POWHEG + PYTHIA 6) [16, 18]. A\nsubstantial difference among the generators was observed, with PYTHIA 8 and POWHEG\n+ PYTHIA 6 providing the best description of the measured observables. These differences\ncan be ascribed to the specific implementation of features such as hard-parton scattering\nmatrix elements, parton showering, hadronization algorithm, and underlying event gener-\nation, which affect the correlation functions of heavy-flavor hadrons and charged particles.\n\n85\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\nThe correlation distributions for trigger electrons in the transverse momentum ranges\n4 < pe\n\nT < 7 GeV/c and 7 < pe\nT < 16 GeV/c were also measured in order to study the\n\ncorrelation shapes in the kinematic ranges where the electrons are dominantly produced\nby charm- and beauty-hadron decays, respectively.\n\nThis chapter is organized as follows: the data samples are reported and the analysis\nprocedure is described in Sec. 6.1. The systematic uncertainties associated with the mea-\nsurements are discussed in Sec. 6.2. The simulation details are discussed in Sec. 6.3. The\nanalysis results are presented and discussed in Sec. 6.4. The chapter is briefly summarized\nin Sec. 6.5.\n\n6.1 Analysis Overview\nThe analysis in this chapter is presented closely following the paper of the published re-\nsults [108]. The results were obtained using minimum bias triggered data of pp collisions\nat\n√\ns = 5.02 TeV and p–Pb collisions at\n\n√\nsNN = 5.02 TeV, recorded with the ALICE\n\ndetector during the LHC Run 2 data-taking period. The pile-up events that contain two or\nmore primary vertices were rejected using an algorithm based on the detection of multi-\nple vertices reconstructed from track segments in the SPD. A uniform acceptance of the\ndetectors were obtained by considering only events with a reconstructed primary vertex\nwithin ±10 cm from the center of the detector along the beam line for both pp and p–\nPb collisions. The number of selected pp and p–Pb events were about 800M and 546M,\nrespectively, corresponding to integrated luminosities of (16.63 ± 0.32) nb−1 [208] and\n(250± 10) µb−1 [209].\n\nThe measurements of two-particle azimuthal correlations between heavy-flavor hadron\ndecay electrons (trigger) and charged (associated) particles were obtained from the corre-\nlation distributions of all identified electrons after subtracting the contribution of those\nelectrons that do not originate from heavy-flavor hadron decays. The effects of the de-\ntector inhomogenieties and the limited two-particle acceptance were corrected with the\nevent-mixing technique. The per-trigger correlation distributions were corrected for the\nefficiency of the associated-particle reconstruction, but they were not corrected for the\ntrigger-electron efficiency, because the efficiency was found to be independent of pT and\nthe correction factor cancels with the per-trigger normalization. The peak yields and\nwidths of the correlation distributions were obtained by applying a fit to the corrected ∆ϕ\n\ndistribution. The same analysis technique was used for both pp and p–Pb measurements.\nThroughout this chapter, the term ”electron” will refer to both electrons and positrons. In\nthe following subsections I briefly present the analysis procedure.\n\n86\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\n6.1.1 Azimuthal Correlation Distribution and Mixed-event Correc-\ntion\n\nThe two-dimensional correlation distribution, denoted by C(∆ϕ,∆η), was computed as\na function of the azimuthal angle difference (∆ϕ) and pseudorapidity difference (∆η)\nbetween a heavy-flavor decay electron and charged particles. The pT interval of the trigger\nparticle was chosen to be 4 < pe\n\nT < 12 GeV/c, as well as 4 < pe\nT < 7 GeV/c and\n\n7 < pe\nT < 16 GeV/c. For the associated particles five pT intervals were chosen between\n\n1 and 7 GeV/c as 1 < passoc\nT < 2 GeV/c, 2 < passoc\n\nT < 3 GeV/c, 3 < passoc\nT < 4 GeV/c,\n\n4 < passoc\nT < 5 GeV/c, and 5 < passoc\n\nT < 7 GeV/c. For each kinematic range, the\ncorrelation distributions were corrected both for the limited pair-acceptance and detector\ninhomogeneities, using the event-mixing technique [210] as shown in Fig. 6.1.\n\nThe mixed-event correlation distribution, ME(∆ϕ,∆η), was obtained by correlating\nelectrons in one event with charged particles from other events that had similar multiplic-\nity and primary-vertex position along the beam direction. The mixed-event distributions\nhave a triangular-like shape as a function of ∆η, due to the limited η coverage of the\ndetector, and is approximately flat as a function of ∆ϕ (see Fig. 6.1). Any non-flatness\nobserved in ∆ϕ would indicate ϕ-dependent detector inefficiencies and inhomogeneities.\nAt (∆ϕ,∆η) ≈ (0, 0) the trigger and associated particles experience the same detector\neffects and therefore the per-trigger correlation distribution is not affected. This property\nwas used to obtain the normalization factor β for the mixed event distribution, which is de-\nfined as the average number of counts in the −0.2 < ∆ϕ < 0.2 and −0.07 < ∆η < 0.07\n\nranges.\nThe d2N/(d∆ηd∆ϕ) mixed-event corrected correlation distribution was obtained as\n\nthe ratio of the correlation distribution from the same event to the mixed event distribution,\nscaled by the normalization factor β, i.e.\n\nd2N\n\nd∆ηd∆ϕ\n≡ S(∆η,∆ϕ) = β × C(∆η,∆ϕ)\n\nME(∆η,∆ϕ)\n, (6.1)\n\nwhere the mixed-event corrected correlation distribution is denoted as S(∆η,∆ϕ).\nDue to the limited size of the heavy-flavor decay electron sample, the two-dimensional\n\ncorrelation distribution was subject to significant statistical fluctuations, especially at large\n|∆η| values. To enhance the precision of the measurement, a one-dimensional S(∆ϕ)\n\ndistribution was obtained by integrating the mixed-event corrected azimuthal correlation\ndistribution over the |∆η| < 1 range.\n\n87\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\n1− 0 1 2 3 4\n\n (rad)ϕ∆1.5−1−\n0.5−\n\n0\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n\nη∆\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n)\n\nϕ∆,η∆(\ne-\n\nas\nso\n\nc\nN\n\nSame events\nc < 12 GeV/e\n\nT\np4 < \n\nc < 2 GeV/assoc\nT\n\np1 < \n\nALICE\nInclusive e - charged particle\n\n = 5.02 TeVspp, \n\n1− 0 1 2 3 4\n\n (rad)ϕ∆1.5−1−\n0.5−0\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n\nη∆\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n(0\n,0\n\n)\ne-\n\nas\nso\n\nc\nN\n\n) \n/ \n\nϕ∆,η∆(\ne-\n\nas\nso\n\nc\nN\n\nALICE\nInclusive e - charged particle\n\n = 5.02 TeVspp, \n\nMixed events\nc < 12 GeV/e\n\nT\np4 < \n\nc < 2 GeV/assoc\nT\n\np1 < \n\n1− 0 1 2 3 4\n\n (rad)ϕ∆1−\n0.5−\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\nη∆\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n)\nϕ∆,η∆(\n\ne-\nas\n\nso\nN\n\nSame events / Mixed events\nc < 12 GeV/e\n\nT\np4 < \n\nc < 2 GeV/assoc\nT\n\np1 < \n\nALICE\nInclusive e - charged particle\n\n = 5.02 TeVspp, \n\nFigure 6.1: Example of measured same-event (top left), mixed-event (top right), and cor-\nrected (bottom) correlation distributions in the 4 < pe\n\nT < 12 GeV/c and 1 < passoc\nT < 2\n\nGeV/c ranges.\n\n6.1.2 Background Subtraction\n\nThe selected trigger electron sample was contaminated by hadrons, which was estimated\nby considering tracks identified as hadrons using nσTPC\n\ne < −3.5. Similarly to the pro-\ncedure applied in Ref. [211], the energy/momentum (E/p) distribution the contaminating\nhadrons was scaled to match the E/p distribution of the heavy-flavor electron candidate\nin the 0.3 < E/p < 0.65 region, which is outside the signal region. The charged hadron\ncontamination was estimated to be ≈ 1% at pT = 4 GeV/c, increasing to ≈ 12% at 16\nGeV/c in both pp and p–Pb collisions. The estimated contamination was then subtracted\nfrom the inclusive electron correlation distribution.\n\nThe selected electrons come from two sources: signal electrons originating from heavy-\nflavor hadron decays and background electrons. The main source for background electrons\nis the Dalitz decay of neutral mesons (π0 and η) and photon conversions in the detector\nmaterial, which produce e+e− pairs with low invariant mass, peaked around zero. The\nbackground electrons were identified using the invariant-mass technique [212, 213], in\n\n88\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\nwhich each selected electron is paired with a partner of opposite sign, and their invariant\nmass is calculated. In order to increase the efficiency of finding the partner electrons, they\nare selected by applying a similar but less strict track-quality and particle-identification\ncriteria than used for selecting the signal electrons [213, 214]. Electron–positron pairs\ncoming from the background have a small invariant mass, while random combinations of\nelectron–positron pairs, such as heavy-flavor decay electrons forming a pair with other\nelectrons, have a wider invariant-mass distribution. This combinatorial contribution was\nestimated from the invariant-mass distribution of like-sign electron pairs. The S(∆ϕ) dis-\ntributions of both like-sign electron pairs and unlike-sign electron pairs were obtained, and\nthe background contribution was evaluated by subtracting the like-sign electron pair dis-\ntribution from the unlike-sign electron pair distribution in the invariant mass region below\n0.14 GeV/c. The tagging efficiency, i.e. the efficiency of finding the partner electron,\nwas estimated with MC simulations. In the pT ranges used in this analysis the background\ncontribution from other sources, such as decays of J/ψ and kaons, is negligible [212].\n\nThe azimuthal correlation distribution of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays\nand charged particles had to be corrected for the inefficiencies in the reconstruction of the\nassociated particles. They also had to be corrected for the contamination of secondary par-\nticles in the associated particle sample. The reconstruction efficiency for charged primary\nparticles was obtained using a different MC sample, which had no embedded particles.\nFor pp this sample was generated by PYTHIA 6 [203] and for p–Pb by HIJING [32].\n\nUtilizing the same MC simulations, the amount of contamination from secondary par-\nticles [215] was also estimated, and for the pT intervals considered, it was found to be in\nthe range 2–4% in pp collisions and 4–6% in p–Pb collisions. The per-trigger normaliza-\ntion was obtained by dividing the fully-corrected azimuthal-correlation distribution by the\nnumber of electrons originating from heavy-flavor hadron decays (N(c,b)→e), expressed as\n\nN (c,b)→e = NInclE −\n1\n\nεtag\n\n[NULS −NLS] , (6.2)\n\nwhere NInclE is the number of electrons in the inclusive sample, NULS is the number of\nunlike-sign electron pairs, NLS is the like-sign electron pairs, and εtag is the efficiency of\nfinding a partner electron.\n\n6.1.3 Characterization of the Azimuthal Distribution\n\nThe measured azimuthal correlation was fitted with two von Mises functions and a constant\nterm b, to quantify its properties:\n\nf(∆ϕ) = b+ YNS\neκNS cos (∆ϕ)\n\n2πI0(κNS)\n+ YAS\n\neκAS cos (∆ϕ−π)\n\n2πI0(κAS)\n. (6.3)\n\n89\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\nwhere the two von Mises functions are used to model circular data, i.e. describe the near-\nside (NS) and away-side (AS) peaks. The terms κNS and κAS in the von Mises function\nare the measure of concentration of NS and AS peaks, respectively. The 1/κ parameter is\nanalogous to the variance σ2, and I0 is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function evaluated\nat κ. The parameters YNS and YAS denote the integral of the near- and away-side peaks,\nrespectively. By symmetry considerations, the mean of the NS is fixed to ∆ϕ = 0 and the\nmean of the AS peak is at ∆ϕ = π. The constant term b is a free parameter and describes\nthe baseline, the physical minimum of the ∆ϕ distribution. The width (σ) of the peaks can\nbe calculated by\n\nσ =\n\n√\n−2 log\n\nI1(κ)\n\nI0(κ)\n, (6.4)\n\nwhere I1 is the first-order modified Bessel function evaluated at κ. The per-trigger yields\nof the NS and AS peaks were obtained by subtracting the baseline b from the distribution\nand integrating over the bin counts in the ranges −3σNS < ∆ϕ < 3σNS and −3σAS <\n\n∆ϕ− π < 3σAS, respectively.\n\n6.2 Systematic Uncertainties\nThere are important systematic uncertainties that affect the ∆ϕ correlation distributions,\nthe per-trigger NS and AS yields, and widths, which need to be taken into account.\nThese uncertainties are related to the electron-track selection procedures, the identifica-\ntion and subtraction of the hadron contamination, the background-electron subtraction,\nthe associated-particle efficiency correction, the mixed-event correction, and the fitting\nprocedure of the correlation distributions. Each source of the aforementioned systematic\nuncertainties was estimated separately, by either varying the selection criteria or by using\nan alternative approach and observing the difference it causes in the results. For each of\nthese variations, their effect on both the NS and AS peak yields and widths were obtained\nby fitting and subtracting the baseline of the newly obtained correlation distributions and\nrecalculating the observables. The uncertainties were then computed separately for each\ntrigger electron and associated particle pT range.\n\nIt was also taken into account that the systematic uncertainties coming from the associated-\nparticle efficiency correction and mixed-event correction are correlated in ∆ϕ. The other\nsources were considered to be independent. A summary of the systematic uncertainties of\nthe correlation distribution, NS and AS yields and widths for 4 < pe\n\nT < 12 GeV/c were\nreported in detail in Ref. [108].\n\nThere are possible biases related to the specific track quality selection for electrons,\nwhich were studied by varying the selection criteria [79]. The uncertainty from track\nselection was found to have a negligible effect on the NS and AS widths.\n\n90\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\nThere is an uncertainty in the electron identification using the TPC and EMCAL sig-\nnals, which was estimated by the variation of the selection criteria, i.e. changing the\nparameters nσTPC\n\ne , E/p, and σ2\nlong. The resulting uncertainties were found to be 2-6% for\n\nthe AS and NS yields, and 2-7% for the AS and NS widths.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the contribution from background electrons was estimated by\n\nthe invariant-mass method. The procedure has a systematic uncertainty that mainly affects\nthe average tagging efficiency. The uncertainty was estimated by varying the track selec-\ntion criteria of the partner electrons, which includes the minimum pT and the invariant-\nmass window of the electron–positron pairs.\n\nThere is also an uncertainty related to the specific selection of associated particles,\nwhich was estimated by the variation of the charged track selection criteria. This included\nthe requirement of registering a hit in one of the two SPD layers of the ITS. The selection\non the distance of closest approach was also varied, which affects the secondary particle\ncontamination. Important to note that this uncertainty was considered to be correlated in\n∆ϕ.\n\nThe limited detector acceptance and local inhomogenieties in the detector have sig-\nnificant effects. These were corrected for by using the mixed-event technique, and the\nuncertainty was estimated by varying the normalization factor β in the mixed-event tech-\nnique.\n\nA non-zero flow v2 of heavy-flavor decay electrons and charged particles can further\naffect the ∆ϕ distributions. Since there are no previous measurements of heavy-flavor\ndecay electron v2 in minimum bias pp and p–Pb collisions, a conservative estimate was\nobtained from measurements in 0–20% central p–Pb collisions in Ref. [216].\n\nSome of the uncertainties come from the fitting procedure, and several checks were\nperformed to study the stability of the correlation distribution fits. Alternative functions\nwere also used for the fit, for example a Gaussian and a generalized Gaussian were utilized\nto fit the NS and AS peaks instead of the von Mises function. Alternative fits were also\nused to fix the baseline value b and study its stability. Instead of the default bin counting\nprocedure, the NS and AS yields were also calculated by integrating the fitting functions\nin the range −3σNS < ∆ϕ < 3σNS and −3σAS < ∆ϕ− π < 3σAS. The maximum varia-\ntion of the above results was taken as the overall systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty\ncoming from the baseline estimation is quoted as an absolute numbers which affects all\n∆ϕ bins by the same value. The uncertainty of the NS and AS peak yields and width for\nthe 4 < pe\n\nT < 12 GeV/c range varies by 4–9% for pp and 10–11% for p–Pb collisions,\nrespectively.\n\nThe systematic uncertainties from the aforementioned sources were found to be similar\nfor the 4 < pe\n\nT < 7 GeV/c and 7 < pe\nT < 16 GeV/c ranges, in both collision systems, and\n\na detailed summary of the systematic uncertainties is reported in Ref. [108].\n\n91\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\n6.3 Simulation Details\nMy main contribution to the analysis was to create detailed simulations in PYTHIA 8\n(including using the Angantyr model to simulate p–Pb collisions) to compare the near-\nand away-side peaks of the azimuthal-correlation distribution in pp and p–Pb collisions\nto the model predictions. This allowed verifying the implementation of the processes of\ncharm- and beauty-quark production, fragmentation, and hadronization, which have an\nimpact on the observables studied in this analysis.\n\nThe models used to compare the measurement in pp collisions are PYTHIA 8 with\nthe Monash tune [21, 204] and EPOS 3.117 [206, 207]. As discussed in Section 2.3.1,\nthe PYTHIA 8 event generator is widely used in particle physics, as it provides an accurate\ndescription of high-energy collisions. It is capable of generating both hard and soft interac-\ntions, initial and final-state parton showers, particle fragmentation, and multi-partonic in-\nteractions. It also incorporates color reconnection mechanisms to rearrange color connec-\ntions between quarks and gluons during hadronization. The prediction of these models for\ncorrelations of D-mesons with charged particles can be found in Refs. [93, 94]. The p–Pb\nmeasurements were compared with PYTHIA 8 Angantyr [29] and EPOS 3.117 [206, 207]\nmodels.\n\nFor PYTHIA 8 simulations, I obtained the correlation distributions for electrons from\ncharm- and beauty-hadron decays separately, and summed them after weighting their rela-\ntive fractions based on FONLL calculations [88, 217, 218]. In Fig. 6.2 I show the fraction\nof the beauty decay electrons to the charm decay electrons, which I used for the reweight-\ning.\n\nAs PYTHIA 8 does not natively support collisions involving nuclei, this feature is im-\nplemented in the Angantyr model, which combines several nucleon–nucleon collisions to\nbuild a proton–nucleus (p–A) or nucleus–nucleus (A–A) collision (see Sec. 2.3.1). I used\nthe Angantyr [29] model to simulate ultra-relativistic p–Pb collisions with the PYTHIA 8\nevent generator. The EPOS3 event generator is largely used for the description of ultra-\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, as discussed in Sec. 2.3.3.\n\nIn the models, the azimuthal correlation function of trigger electrons from charm- and\nbeauty-hadron decays with charged particles was evaluated using the same prescriptions\napplied for data analysis in terms of kinematic and particle-species selections. The peak\nproperties of the correlation functions were obtained by following the same approach em-\nployed in data, i.e. by fitting the distributions with two von Mises functions and a constant\nterm.\n\n92\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n (GeV/c)\n\nT\nelectron p\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n)\n\nc\nc\n\nσ\n +\n\n \nb\n\nb\nσ\n\n /\n (\n\nb\nb\n\nσ\n\n = 5.03 TeVspp \nFONLL  calculations\n\nFigure 6.2: The fraction σbb̄/(σbb̄ + σcc̄) as a function of electron pT which I used for the\nFONLL reweighting.\n\n6.4 Results\nIn this section I present the main results of the azimuthal correlations analysis of heavy-\nflavor decay electrons with charged particles, closely following our published article [108].\n\n6.4.1 Comparison of the Results in pp and p–Pb Collisions\n\nIn Fig. 6.3 the azimuthal-correlation distributions are shown for different passoc\nT ranges.\n\nThe three top panels present the results for pp collisions, while the bottom three panels\ncontain the p–Pb collision results. The distributions are normalized with the number of\nheavy-flavor decay electrons. The baseline is fitted with a constant and shown with a\ngreen line, together with the absolute systematic uncertainty of the baseline estimation as\na solid box at ∆ϕ ∼ −2 rad. The correlated systematic uncertainties from the associated\nparticle selection and mixed-event correction are shown for each passoc\n\nT range under the\nplotted curves. It can be seen that the near- and away-side peaks are described well by\nthe von Mises fit function in all of the passoc\n\nT ranges. The baseline contribution is higher in\np–Pb collisions compared to pp collisions, due to the larger charged-particle multiplicity.\nHowever, its absolute value decreases with increasing passoc\n\nT for both pp and p–Pb colli-\nsions.

The statistical uncertainties are shown as vertical lines,\nwhile the systematic uncertainties are shown as empty boxes.\n\nThe baseline-subtracted azimuthal-correlation distributions are compared for pp and\np–Pb collisions in Fig. 6.4. The three panels contain results for three different passoc\n\nT ranges,\nwhile the heavy-flavor decay electron is in the range 4 < pe\n\nT < 12 GeV/c. It can be\nseen that the NS and AS peaks decrease with increasing passoc\n\nT for both pp and p–Pb.\nA tendency for the NS peak to become more collimated with increasing passoc\n\nT is also\nvisible. The overall profile of the correlation peaks is consistent in pp and p–Pb collisions\nwithin statistical and systematic uncertainties. The results indicate that there are no visible\ncold-nuclear matter effects impacting heavy-quark fragmentation and hadronization in the\nmeasured pT range. This observation is consistent with previous measurements of D-\nmeson correlations with charged particles [93, 94].\n\nIn order to quantitatively compare the azimuthal-correlation distributions in pp and\np–Pb data, the per-trigger AS and NS peak yields are plotted for both collision systems in\nFig. 6.5 in the top panels, while the peak widths are plotted in the bottom panels. These\nfit parameters are plotted as a function of passoc\n\nT in the 4 < pe\nT < 12 GeV/c electron mo-\n\nmentum range. The systematic uncertainties on the ratio consider all sources uncorrelated\nbetween pp and p–Pb collisions except for the baseline estimation.

The statistical uncertainties\nare shown as vertical lines, while the systematic uncertainties are shown as empty boxes.\n\nThe total uncertainty then was obtained by taking the quadratic sum of the correlated and\nuncorrelated uncertainties.\n\nBoth the NS and AS yields show a trend of decreasing in value as we go for higher\npassoc\n\nT . This result is consistent within uncertainties for both pp and p–Pb collision systems\nfor all measured passoc\n\nT ranges. The decrease in yields with increasing passoc\nT can be ex-\n\nplained by the heavy quarks on average fragmenting hard into heavy-flavor hadrons. Due\nto energy conservation, and since a large fraction of the energy is spent on fragmenting\ninto heavy-flavor hadron, it is on average more likely that the associated particles to the\ndecay electron are produced with lower pT. The NS width values also show a trend of\ndecreasing with increasing passoc\n\nT , with having a value of about 0.3 at passoc\nT = 1 GeV/c.\n\nAt passoc\nT = 6 GeV/c the NS width is roughly 0.15, having a significance of about 3σ for\n\nboth pp and p–Pb collision systems. The significance was calculated by taking the dif-\nference of the widths in the lowest and highest passoc\n\nT ranges, and also taking into account\nboth statistical and systematic uncertainties. The AS widths on the other hand seem to be\nindependent of the passoc\n\nT range, and take a value around 0.5. The NS peak distribution is\nclosely connected to the fragmentation of the jet which contains the trigger particle.\n\nThe narrowing of the NS width with increasing passoc\nT indicates that the charged par-\n\nticles with higher pT tend to be closer to the jet-axis, which can be approximated by the\ndirection of the trigger electron. This parallels the higher pT emissions from heavy quarks\nbeing more collinear to it than lower pT emissions. The AS peak exhibits a lower sensitiv-\nity to the fragmentation of a specific heavy quark, because it can contain particles produced\nvia the fragmentation of heavy quarks originating from processes that are not azimuthally\nback-to-back, including certain next-to-leading order processes. These processes can have\ndifferent relative fractions depending on the pT of the heavy quark. For example, consid-\nering gluon splitting, the AS peak can also include particles originating from the recoil\ngluon not directly associated with the heavy quarks produced in the event. Even consid-\nering back-to-back processes, the correlation between the transverse momentum of the\n\n95\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\nheavy-flavor decay electron and the heavy quark on the opposite side in the event, which\nis responsible for generating the AS peak through fragmentation, is significantly weaker\nthan for the near-side peak.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n1−10\n\n1\n\nA\nss\n\noc\nia\n\nte\nd \n\nyi\nel\n\nd\n charged particle−e →(c,b)\n\nc < 12 GeV/ e\nT\n\np4 < \n\nNSσ| < 3ϕ∆|\n\nNear-side\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n1−10\n\n1\n\nA\nss\n\noc\nia\n\nte\nd \n\nyi\nel\n\nd\n\n = 5.02 TeVspp, \n\n = 5.02 TeVNNsPb, −p\n\nAS\nσ| < 3π − ϕ∆|\n\nALICE\nAway-side\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/\n\n assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5P\nb\n\n−p\nY\n\nie\nld\n\npp\nY\n\nie\nld\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/\n\n assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nR\nat\n\nio\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nσ\n\nassoc\nT\n\np > e\nT\n\np\n\n| < 0.6eη|\n| < 1η∆|\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nP\nb\n\n−p σ\npp σ\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5R\nat\n\nio\n\nFigure 6.5: The near- and away-side per-trigger yields (top panels) and widths (bottom\npanels) as a function of passoc\n\nT , for 4 < pe\nT < 12 GeV/c.

However, the EPOS3 predictions show some deviation from\nthe measured NS and AS peaks in the highest passoc\n\nT range, and this deviation from the data\nis much more pronounced for the p–Pb collision data. In Figs. 6.8 and 6.9 we also compare\nwith the model predictions the extracted fit parameters: the peak yields and widths of\nthe distributions. The PYTHIA 8/Angantyr simulations predict NS and AS yields which\ndecrease with increasing passoc\n\nT and this is consistent with the data within statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties.\n\nThe NS widths simulated by PYTHIA 8/Angantyr decrease as passoc\nT increases, which\n\nis consistent with the data in both collision systems. On the other hand, the AS widths\nshow a slightly decreasing trend as a function of passoc\n\nT , which is also consistent with data\nwithin statistical and systematic uncertainties in both collision systems. The EPOS3 model\ndescribes the data qualitatively in pp collisions within statistical and systematic uncertain-\nties. For p–Pb collisions it overestimates the NS peak yield for high passoc\n\nT , but the AS peak\nyield remain consistent with the data within statistical and systematic uncertainties. As it\ncan also be seen on the figures, the EPOS3 event generator overestimates the NS widths\nand underestimate the AS widths for all the passoc\n\nT ranges in both pp and p–Pb collisions.\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n (rad)ϕ∆\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5)\n-1\n\n (\nra\n\nd\nϕ∆\n\n/d\n a\n\nss\noc\n\nN\n de\n\n→\n(c\n\n,b\n)\n\nN\n1/\n\n charged particle−e →(c,b)\n\nALICE\n\n 1.4%±corr. syst. unc. \n\nc < 2 GeV/assoc\nT\n\np1 < \n\nc < 12 GeV/e\nT\n\np4 < \n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n (rad)ϕ∆\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n)\n-1\n\n (\nra\n\nd\nϕ∆\n\n/d\n a\n\nss\noc\n\nN\n de\n\n→\n(c\n\n,b\n)\n\nN\n1/\n\n = 5.02 TeVspp, \nPYTHIA8 Monash\nEPOS3\n\n 1.4%±corr. syst. unc. \n\nc < 3 GeV/assoc\nT\n\np2 < \n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n (rad)ϕ∆\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n)\n-1\n\n (\nra\n\nd\nϕ∆\n\n/d\n a\n\nss\noc\n\nN\n d\n\ne\n→\n\n(c\n,b\n\n)\nN\n\n1/\n\nSyst. unc. on baseline\n\n| < 1η∆| < 0.6, |eη|\n\nc < 7 GeV/assoc\nT\n\np5 < \n\n 2.2%±corr. syst. unc. \n\nassoc\nT\n\np > e\nT\n\np\n\nFigure 6.6: The azimuthal-correlation distribution compared with model predictions after\nbaseline subtraction, for 4 < pe\n\nT < 12 GeV/c, in different passoc\nT ranges.

The statistical\n\nuncertainties are shown as vertical lines, while the systematic uncertainties are shown as\nempty boxes.\n\nSince the charm and beauty quarks fragment differently, we can expect the azimuthal\ncorrelation distributions of the electrons originating from these quarks to have a flavor\ndependence. For a given quark flavor, it is also expected to have a pe\n\nT-dependence due\nto the electron-producing partons having different energies and different fraction of LO\nand NLO processes being involved in their production. Azimuthal correlation distribution\nmeasurements in the ranges 4 < pe\n\nT < 7 GeV/c and 7 < pe\nT < 16 GeV/c provide valu-\n\nable information on fragmentation because the latter pe\nT range is dominated by electrons\n\noriginating from beauty-hadron decays. The results for the yields and widths of the dis-\ntributions in these regions are shown in Fig. 6.10 and 6.11, and the ratios between the\nyields of in the 7 < pe\n\nT < 16 GeV/c and 4 < pe\nT < 7 GeV/c regions is shown in the\n\nsecond row of the figures. The two figures show that the associated yield for both the near-\nside and away-side peaks are higher in the range where the trigger electron has a higher\nmomentum, and this is true for both collision systems. This is to be expected due to the\nheavy-flavor quark fragmentation process with higher trigger electron usually producing a\nlarger amount of associated particles.\n\nThe near-side peak width values are decreasing with passoc\nT for both pe\n\nT ranges. On\nthe other hand, the away-side width values show an approximately flat trend for both\npe\n\nT ranges. It is important to note that the passoc\nT < pe\n\nT selection condition introduces\na kinematic bias, because measuring the distributions in the 4 < pe\n\nT < 7 GeV/c and\n4 < passoc\n\nT < 7 GeV/c ranges results in missing some associated particles.\nThe figures also show the comparison of the measured yield and width values to model\n\ncalculations in PYTHIA 8/Angantyr and EPOS3. The PYTHIA 8/Angantyr simulations\ndescribe the data within uncertainties for both trigger electron ranges. The EPOS3 predic-\ntions of the yields are also consistent with data for both trigger electron intervals, however\nthe predicted trend of the widths differ from data. Both MC generators describe the ratio\nof the yields and widths in both pe\n\nT ranges well.\n\n98\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nA\nss\n\noc\nia\n\nte\nd \n\nyi\nel\n\nd\n\n charged particle−e →(c,b)\nNear-side\n\nc < 12 GeV/e\nT\n\np4 < \n\nNSσ| < 3ϕ∆|\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nA\nw\n\nay\n-s\n\nid\ne \n\nas\nso\n\nci\nat\n\ned\n y\n\nie\nld\n\n = 5.02 TeVspp, \n\nPYTHIA8 Monash\n\nEPOS3\n\nALICE Away-side\n\nAS\nσ| < 3π − ϕ∆|\n\nALICE\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/\n\n assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5da\nta\n\nY\nie\n\nldm\nod\n\nel\nY\n\nie\nld\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/\n\n assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nR\nat\n\nio\n to\n\n d\nat\n\na\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nσ\n\n| < 1η∆| < 0.6, |eη|\nassoc\nT\n\np > e\nT\n\np\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nA\nw\n\nay\n-s\n\nid\ne \n\nsi\ngm\n\na\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nda\nta\n\nσm\nod\n\nel\nσ\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nA\nLI\n\nC\nE\n\n / \nM\n\nO\nD\n\nE\nL\n\nFigure 6.8: The near- and away-side per-trigger yields (top panels) and widths (bottom\npanels) as a function of passoc\n\nT , for 4 < pe\nT < 12 GeV/c, compared with predictions from\n\nPYTHIA 8 Monash tune and EPOS3.

The near-side yields for trigger electrons from beauty-hadron de-\ncays are observed to be lower than those from charm-hadron decays, in both pe\n\nT inter-\nvals. This observation can be explained by the harder fragmentation of beauty quarks into\nbeauty hadrons, compared to that of charm quarks, therefore less energy remaining for the\nproduction of other particles in the parton shower.\n\n99\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n\nA\nss\n\noc\nia\n\nte\nd \n\nyi\nel\n\nd\n\nNear-side\n charged particle−e →(c,b)\n\nc < 12 GeV/e\nT\n\np4 < \n\nNSσ| < 3ϕ∆|\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nA\nw\n\nay\n-s\n\nid\ne \n\nas\nso\n\nci\nat\n\ned\n y\n\nie\nld\n\n = 5.02 TeVNNsPb, −p\nPYTHIA8 Angantyr\nEPOS3\n\nALICE Away-side\n\nAS\nσ| < 3π − ϕ∆|\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/\n\n assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n2\n\nda\nta\n\nY\nie\n\nldm\nod\n\nel\nY\n\nie\nld\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/\n\n assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nR\nat\n\nio\n to\n\n d\nat\n\na\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nσ\n\n| < 1η∆| < 0.6, |eη|\nassoc\nT\n\np > e\nT\n\np\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nA\nw\n\nay\n-s\n\nid\ne \n\nsi\ngm\n\na\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n2\n\nda\nta\n\nσm\nod\n\nel\nσ\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/ assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nA\nLI\n\nC\nE\n\n / \nM\n\nO\nD\n\nE\nL\n\nFigure 6.9: The near- and away-side per-trigger yields (top panels) and widths (bottom\npanels), as a function of passoc\n\nT , for 4 < pe\nT < 12 GeV/c, compared with predictions\n\nfrom PYTHIA 8 Angantyr and EPOS3.

On the other hand, the extracted\nnear- and away-side per-trigger yields and widths as a function of the associated particle\npT provide access to the momentum distribution of the particles fragmented from a hard\nparton, and allow for a differential study of jet substructure. The per-trigger yield as a\nfunction of the charged (associate) particle pT was found to have the same trend in both\npp and p–Pb collisions, namely it decreases as passoc\n\nT increases.\n\n102\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nY\nie\n\nld\n\nPYTHIA8 Monash\n\n = 5.02 TeVspp, \n\nNear-side\n\nNSσ| < 3ϕ∆|\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nY\nie\n\nld Away-side\n\nAS\nσ| < 3π − ϕ∆|\n\n| < 1η∆| < 0.6, |eη|\nassoc\nT\n\np > e\nT\n\np\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/assoc\n\nT\np\n\n1\n\n2 e\n→\n\n(c\n, b\n\n) \nR\n\nat\nio\n\n to\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/assoc\n\nT\np\n\n1\n\n2\n\nR\nat\n\nio\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nσ\n\n) e→ (c→ e   b →)      c c (GeV/e\nT\n\np\n\n < 7e\nT\n\np4 <         \n\n < 16e\nT\n\np7 < \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/assoc\n\nT\np\n\n0.5\n\n1σ\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/assoc\n\nT\np\n\n1\n\n2 e\n→\n\n(c\n, b\n\n) \nR\n\nat\nio\n\n to\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n)c (GeV/assoc\n\nT\np\n\n1\n\n2 e\n→\n\n(c\n, b\n\n) \nR\n\nat\nio\n\n to\n\nFigure 6.12: The PYTHIA 8 Monash prediction for NS and AS per-trigger yields (top\npanels) and widths (bottom panels) in two pe\n\nT ranges: 4 < pe\nT < 7 GeV/c and 7 < pe\n\nT < 16\nGeV/c, as a function of passoc\n\nT . The ratios to c, b→ e yields and widths are also shown.\nThe statistical uncertainties are shown as vertical lines, while the systematic uncertainties\nare shown as empty boxes.\n\nThe pT-dependence of the width is also consistent between the two collision systems:\nthe width of the near-side peak decreases with increasing passoc\n\nT and the away-side peak\nwidth has no pronounced trend as a function of passoc\n\nT . All observables, including the ∆ϕ\n\ndistributions, per-trigger yields, and widths in both pp and p–Pb collisions were compared\nwith predictions from EPOS3 and PYTHIA 8 simulations, where the latter was utilized\nwith the Monash tune to simulate pp collisions, and the Angantyr model to simulate p–Pb\ncollisions. The best description was provided by the PYTHIA 8 simulations, which gave\ngood predictions for the yields and widths of both the near- and away-side peaks.\n\n103\n\n\n\nChapter 6 – Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons\n\nThe relative fraction of electrons originating from charm- and beauty-hadron decays\nwas shown to have a strong pT dependence, and this quality was exploited by studying\nthe correlation distribution in different kinematic regions, such as 4 < pe\n\nT < 7 GeV/c and\n7 < pe\n\nT < 16 GeV/c, where the latter range is dominated by the decays of beauty-hadrons.\nComparing the aforementioned trigger pT ranges, the 7 < pe\n\nT < 16 GeV/c range\nhas a systematically larger per-trigger yield, because more particles are produced from\nthe fragmentation of the more energetic heavy-quark. This effect is actually stronger than\nthe increased beauty-hadron decays over charmed hadron decays, which according to the\nPYTHIA 8 studies results in lower correlation peak yields in this region than those of\nelectrons originating from charm quarks.\n\nThe PYTHIA 8 studies also shed light on the observation of the near- and away-side\nwidths being similar for both pe\n\nT ranges. This happens due to competing effects between\nthe larger boost of the initial heavy quark leading to a stronger collimation of the peaks\nwith increasing pe\n\nT for both charm- and beauty-origin contributions, and the broader peak\nwidths for trigger electrons originating from beauty-hadron decays, whose contribution\nincreases with pe\n\nT.\nThese results also contribute to future Pb–Pb measurements at the same center-of-mass\n\nenergy by serving as a reference. Finding modifications in the correlation functions in\nheavy-ion collisions could provide valuable information on the dynamics of heavy-flavor\nquarks inside the quark-gluon plasma [107].\n\n104\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nEnhanced Production of Charmed\nBaryons\n\nCharmed baryon-to-meson ratios are sensitive probes of heavy-quark fragmentation. The\nproduction of these heavy-flavor hadrons in high-energy collisions is usually described\nby the factorization approach (see Sec. 2.6.1). Fragmentation functions have been as-\nsumed to be universal across different collision systems. However, the ALICE and CMS\nexperiments at the LHC observed a low-momentum enhancement in the production of\ncharmed Λ+\n\nc baryons compared to charmed D0 mesons in high-energy proton–proton col-\nlisions, with respect to model calculations which were tuned for electron-positron colli-\nsions [114, 219, 220]. Since the PDF and partonic cross sections cancel in the ratio, this\nsuggests that the universality of charm fragmentation is not fulfilled.\n\nThere have been many proposed models which try to explain the observed excess pro-\nduction, such as color reconnection beyond leading color approximation (CR-BLC) [122],\nquark recombination mechanism (QCM) [221], feed-down from a largely augmented set\nof (so-far directly unobserved) higher mass charm-baryon states [123], and the Catania\nmodel based on a coalescence plus fragmentation approach [222]. Although all these sce-\nnarios tend to qualitatively describe the trends observed for the Λ+\n\nc production, most of\nthem fall short in explaining the yields and ratios of further charmed baryonic states e.g.\nΞ0,+\n\nc and Σ0,++\nc [223]. Recently published data show that the Λ+\n\nc enhancement correlates\nwith event multiplicity [112]. Trends observed in the event multiplicity are reproduced\nwell with models containing color reconnection beyond leading color approximation. This\nis expected since in this latter scenario, CR is linked to multiple-parton interactions (MPI),\nwhich in turn is related to the activity of the underlying event (UE) [130] and thus to the\nevent multiplicity.\n\n105\n\n\n\nChapter 7 – Enhanced Production of Charmed Baryons\n\nIn this chapter I present the studies concerning the charm-baryon enhancement using\nsimulations with color reconnection beyond leading color approximation, utilizing mul-\ntiple event-activity classifiers which are sensitive to the origin of the charm production.\nThe proposed methods can be used in future analysis of experimental data from the ongo-\ning ALICE Run 3 data taking period to achieve a high discriminatory power between the\ndifferent proposed scenarios.\n\n7.1 Analysis Method\n\nFor this analysis I simulated 1 billion pp collisions at\n√\ns = 13 TeV center-of-mass en-\n\nergy using the PYTHIA 8.303 Monte Carlo (MC) event generator with the Monash tune\nand softQCD settings [12], with the color reconnection beyond leading color approxima-\ntion model [122] implemented. The CR-BLC model has three different modes which are\nbased on the Monash tune, established using a broad set of minimum-bias, Drell-Yan and\nunderlying-event data from the LHC to constrain the parameters of the initial-state radia-\ntion and multiple parton interactions, combined with data from SPS and the Tevatron LHC\nto constrain the energy scaling [21].\n\nMode 2 of the CR-BLC model, which includes time dilation using the boost factor\nobtained from the final-state mass of the dipoles and requires a causal connection of all\ndipoles, is known to reproduce the trends in Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 ratios [114, 224] and therefore I chose\n\nMode 2 as the default setting. The Mode 0 results, which use no time-dilation constraints\nand where the amount of CR is controlled by the invariant mass scale parameter m0, yield\nqualitatively similar results to Mode 2 with slightly less enhancement. Finally, Mode 3,\nwhich has time dilation constraints but only requires a single causal connection, was found\nto vastly overestimate the underlying event. Final-state charged particles were selected at\nmid-rapidity, in the pseudo-rapidity window |η| < 1 and in the full range of the azimuth\nangle ϕ, with a minimum transverse momentum pT > 0.15 GeV/c. The charmed Λ+\n\nc and\nD0 hadrons, and their charged conjugates, were selected in the rapidity window |y| < 0.5\n\nbased on their MC particle numbering scheme codes [225]. In the following I refer to both\nthe particles and their charge conjugates simply as Λ+\n\nc and D0. It must be noted that the\nfeed-down contribution from beauty hadrons is not removed, as its contribution to the ratio\nis only about 5% to 10% depending on the pT.\n\nTo quantitatively characterize an event, first I used the event multiplicity Nch, defined\nas the number of all charged final state particles in the event in the mid-rapidity accep-\ntance defined above. Since Nch is defined in the same pseudorapidity range where the\ncharmed-hadron yields are computed, effects observed via Nch may be influenced by au-\ntocorrelation. Therefore I also used the forward multiplicity Nfw, which I defined as the\nnumber of charged particles within the acceptance 2 < |η| < 5.\n\n106\n\n\n\nChapter 7 – Enhanced Production of Charmed Baryons\n\nWhile a dependence of Λ+\nc /D\n\n0 on general event-activity observables is already seen\nin the experiment [112], these experimental results do not carry direct information on\nwhether the observed pattern is governed by charm fragmentation in jets or hadronization\nin the underlying event. To address this question, I characterized the event with RT and\nRNC. As described in Sec. 2.7.2, these observables are selectively sensitive to the activity\nin the underlying-event or to that caused by high-momentum jets in the leading process.\nOne such observable is the transverse event-activity classifierRT ≡ N trans\n\nch /〈N trans\nch 〉 [130],\n\nwhere N trans\nch is the charged-hadron multiplicity in the transverse region defined the fol-\n\nlowing way. The charged final-state hadron with the highest transverse momentum within\nthe acceptance (the trigger hadron) is selected and the event is accepted only if the trigger\nhadron has a transverse momentum ptrig\n\nT > 5 GeV/c. N trans\nch is then the number of charged\n\nfinal-state hadrons in the transverse side, defined with the azimuth angle relative to the\ntrigger hadron as π\n\n3\n< |∆φ| < 2π\n\n3\nwithin |η| < 1. Since the trigger hadron most likely\n\ncomes from a high-momentum jet initiated by the leading process, and the recoil jet is\nexpected to show up at the opposite side, N transverse\n\nch is dominated by hadrons from the un-\nderlying event [131]. In models such as PYTHIA that describe events in terms of MPI, RT\n\nis strongly correlated with the number of MPIs in an event [130]. Analogously, I defined\nthe near-side cone activity RNC ≡ Nnear-side cone\n\nch /〈Nnear-side cone\nch 〉 in a narrow cone around\n\nthe trigger particle,\n√\n\n∆φ2 + ∆η2 < 0.5. As this region is dominated by the fragments of\nthe jet containing the trigger particle, RNC will be primarily determined by the multiplicity\nof the jet initiated by the leading hard process.\n\nTo quantify the jettiness and underlying event activity of events without a high-pT\n\ntrigger particle, I used the transverse spherocity S0 [132], as defined in Section 2.7.2.\nThe transverse spherocity takes values between 0 and 1. Isotropic events correspond to\nS0 → 1, while S0 → 0 for jetty events with strongly collimated particles. To overcome\nthe limitations of the transverse spherocity, I also used flattenicity [134] to characterize\nthe event. In this analysis I divided the η axis into 10 and the φ axis into 8 ranges of equal\nlength, and used 80 flattenicity cells altogether.\n\nWhileNMPI is not a physically observable quantity, it is closely related to the observed\ncharmed-baryon enhancement in the model class under investigation [125]. Therefore I\nused NMPI as the most handy quantity to represent the relation of the enhancement to the\nfinal-state event activity. In this analysis I propose easily accessible physical observables\nthat are powerful in distinguishing between different model scenarios and can be directly\nused in future data comparison.\n\nIn each event I selected charm hadrons in the central rapidity window |y| < 0.5. I ana-\nlyzed the charmed baryons Λ+\n\nc , Σ++\nc and Σ0\n\nc (referred to as Σ0,++\nc ), Ξ+\n\nc and Ξ0\nc (referred to\n\nas Ξ0,+\nc ), Ω0\n\nc and Ω∗0c (referred to as Ω0\nc), as well as the charmed D0 meson. I excluded feed-\n\ndown from beauty hadrons. In case of Λ+\nc a substantial contribution comes from decays of\n\nother charm-baryon (predominantly the Σ0,++\nc ) states. Based on event-generator informa-\n\ntion I evaluated Λ+\nc contributions from direct hadronization, i.e. separately from those that\n\n107\n\n\n\nChapter 7 – Enhanced Production of Charmed Baryons\n\nstem from the decay of Σ0,++\nc baryons. Since the meson-to-baryon and baryon-to-baryon\n\nratios are sensitive to differences in fragmentation mechanisms without sensitivity to the\nheavy-flavor production cross section, I used the ratios of the different charmed-baryon\nto the D0 meson as well as to the Λ+\n\nc , as a function of pT and different event activity\nclasses. The event-activity-class limits, summarized in Table 7.1, were determined to con-\ntain roughly similar number of events for each variable under study.\n\nclass #1 #2 #3 #4 #5\nNch ≤15 16–30 31–40 41–50 ≥51\nNfw ≤45 46–90 91–120 121–150 ≥151\nRT <0.5 0.5–1.0 1.0–1.5 1.5–2.0 >2.0\nRNC <0.5 0.5–1.0 1.0–1.5 1.5–2.0 >2.0\nS0 0.0–0.25 0.25–0.45 0.45–0.55 0.55–0.75 0.75–1.0\nρ 0.0–1.0 1.0–1.5 1.5–2.0 2.0–2.5 >2.5\n\nNMPI ≤5 6–10 11–13 14–16 ≥17\n\nTable 7.1: Definition of event classes for the different event-activity classifiers.\n\n7.2 The Λ+\nc /D0 Ratio\n\nIn Fig. 7.1 I compare the Λ+\nc to D0 ratios for different charged event multiplicity bins\n\nfor CR-BLC Mode 2 for both mid-rapidity (left) and forward multiplicities (center). In\nthe left and center panels of Fig. 7.1 ALICE results from Ref. [112] are also shown for\ncomparison. On the right hand side, the Λ+\n\nc to D0 ratios are shown in different classes of\nNMPI, extracted from Monte Carlo information. In the left panel it can be seen that the Λ+\n\nc\n\nyield has a significant dependence on the multiplicity, as it increases with the multiplicity.\nThis qualitatively reproduces the behavior seen in ALICE data [112].\n\nIn the center panel one can observe a similar dependence on the forward multiplicity:\nthe Λ+\n\nc yield again increases for higher forward multiplicities. In the latter case, corre-\nlation between the measured charmed-hadron yields from leading hard processes and the\nhigh charged-hadron multiplicity stemming from the same charmed jets is reduced. Since\nthe yields increase in a similar way for both central and forward rapidity, the multiplicity-\ndependence according to my simulation results is not driven by charm-production in jets.\nBoth trends are well reproduced by the trends observed in NMPI classes, suggesting again\nthat the enhancement is tied to charm production in the underlying event, driven by MPI\nin the CR-BLC model. Precise multi-differential measurements in both the central and\nforward rapidity regime from the ongoing and upcoming high-luminosity data-taking pe-\nriods at the LHC experiments will be essential to shed light on the exact nature of Λ+\n\nc\n\nenhancement and validate the predictions obtained using the CR-BLC model.\n\n108\n\n\n\nChapter 7 – Enhanced Production of Charmed Baryons\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n (GeV/c)\n\nT\np\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n r\nat\n\nio\n0\n\n to\n D\n\nc\nΛ\n\ncΛall cΛdirect \n\n>η/dch <dNtrklN\nALICE [2111.11948]\n\n  6.9 INEL>0\n\n  3.1\n\n  10.5\n\n  22.6\n\n  37.8\n\n=13 TeVspp \nPYTHIA8 mode2\n\nMinimum bias\n\n 15≤ chN\n\n 16-30chN\n\n 31-40chN\n\n 41-50chN\n\n 51≥ chN\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n (GeV/c)\n\nT\np\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n r\nat\n\nio\n0\n\n to\n D\n\nc\nΛ\n\ncΛall cΛdirect \n\n>η/dch <dNV0MN\nALICE [2111.11948]\n\n  6.9 INEL>0\n\n  4.4\n\n  13.8\n\n  31.5\n\n=13 TeVspp \nPYTHIA8 mode2\n\nMinimum bias\n\n 45≤ fwN\n\n 46-90fwN\n\n 91-120fwN\n\n 121-150fwN\n\n 151≥ fwN\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n (GeV/c)\n\nT\np\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n r\nat\n\nio\n0\n\n to\n D\n\nc\nΛ\n\ncΛall cΛdirect \n\n=13 TeVspp \nPYTHIA8 mode2\n\nMinimum bias\n\n 5≤ mpiN\n\n 6-10mpiN\n\n 11-13mpiN\n\n 14-16mpiN\n\n 17≥ mpiN\n\nFigure 7.1: Λ+\nc /D\n\n0 ratios from minimum-bias PYTHIA 8 simulations with CR-BLC as a\nfunction of pT, shown as solid lines, for three different event-activity classifiers: charged-\nhadron multiplicity at mid-rapidity (Nch, left), charged-hadron multiplicity at forward-\nrapidity (Nfw, center), and number of multiparton-interactions (NMPI, right). The results\nfor theNch andNfw classes are also compared to data from ALICE [112]. The contribution\nof direct Λ+\n\nc production is shown separately as dashed lines in each panel.\n\nIn the upper row of Fig. 7.2 I plot the Λ+\nc to D0 ratios as a function of pT for different\n\nRT and RNC classes. In the case of the transverse-side multiplicities, higher RT values\ncorrespond to stronger Λ+\n\nc enhancement. On the other hand, for different near-side-cone\nmultiplicities the Λ+\n\nc to D0 ratios remain consistent within fluctuations in the pT < 6 GeV/c\nrange, while there is some difference for pT > 6 GeV/c. We can conclude therefore, that in\nthe model class under investigation the increased Λ+\n\nc yield is primarily connected to charm\nproduction within the underlying event and not the jet region. This is further highlighted in\nthe bottom panel of Fig. 7.2, where I show the Λ+\n\nc to D0 ratio integrated over the semi-soft\n(or coalescence) regime 2 < pT < 6 GeV/c, plotted as a function of RT as well as RNC.\nWhile the change from small to large RT values is almost threefold, there is a very slight\ndependence on RNC, which may be caused by the UE that is not subtracted from the jet\nregion.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3 I evaluated the Λ+\nc /D\n\n0 excess in terms of transverse spherocity classes. The\npresence of high-momentum jets correlates with the event multiplicity. To minimize the ef-\nfect of this correlation, we observe spherocity in fixed multiplicity intervals. Fig. 7.3 (left)\nshows the Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 ratio for different spherocity bins for events with Nch > 50. Jetty events\n\nshow a significantly smaller Λ+\nc enhancement than more isotropic events. In the right panel\n\nI show the Λ+\nc /D\n\n0 ratios for different S0 bins, integrated over the coalescence regime and\nplotted as a function of the Nch classes. It can be observed that for lower multiplicity\nevents the dependence of the ratio on spherocity is weak, while for higher multiplicities\nthe separation between the ratios for low and high S0 values becomes more significant.\nThis pattern can can be understood by considering that in case of lower-multiplicity events\nmost of the contribution comes from a single process, therefore the separation of the lead-\n\n109\n\n\n\nChapter 7 – Enhanced Production of Charmed Baryons\n\n#1 #2 #3 #4 #5\n\n classnc or RTR\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n in\n s\n\nem\ni-s\n\nof\nt r\n\neg\nim\n\ne\n0\n\n/D\n+ c\n\nΛ\n\n=13 TeVsPYTHIA8 mode2 pp \n classesTR\n classesNCR\n>5 GeV/c averagetrig\n\nT\np\n\nFigure 7.2: Λ+\nc to D0 ratios of hadron-triggered events as a function of pT, for different\n\nRT bins (top left) and RNC bins (top right), together with multiplicity-inclusive hadron-\ntriggered data, shown for reference.

In the CR-BLC model [122] the excess is linked to the MPI,\nwhich is strongly correlated with the underlying-event (UE) activity [130]. I used this\nmodel to conduct detailed studies for the Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 ratios in proton–proton collisions at\n\n√\ns\n\n=13 TeV. We saw that Λ+\nc /D\n\n0 enhancement strongly depends on the final-state hadron\nmultiplicity both in the central and the forward rapidity region. This behavior is supported\nby recent ALICE measurements that had been since finalized [112], hinting that the mul-\ntiplicities taken from forward and central regions show the same enhancement qualities,\ntherefore attesting to the usability of the CR-BLC scenario. I also proposed to observe\nthe Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 ratio in event classes that are determined based on the activity within the un-\n\nderlying event, as well as the multiplicity of the jet caused by the leading process, and\nconcluded that the charmed-baryon enhancement can be observed to depend on the UE\nactivity but not on the activity inside the jet region.\n\nIn this section I extend my studies of Λ+\nc (qqc, I = 0) to the charmed baryon states\n\nΣ0,++\nc (qqc, I = 1), Ξ0,+\n\nc (qsc) and Ω0\nc (ssc), to pin down the relative contributions of\n\nstrangeness and charm in the baryon enhancement, and also address the role of the isospin.\nWhile I phrase the observations in terms of MPI using the CR-BLC scenario [122], I\nprovide predictions for observables that are accessible for the experiment already in the\nLHC Run3 data-taking phase.\n\nThe calculations from PYTHIA 8 with CR-BLC reproduce data trends in which the\nenhancement of the Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 ratio strongly correlates with the event multiplicities. It should\n\nbe noted that the multiplicity classes in the model calculations do not correspond exactly\nto the ones from Ref. [112], and in case of forward rapidity the pseudorapidity definition\nalso differs. In the ALICE analysis the multiplicity in the forward rapidity region has\nbeen estimated from the percentile distribution of the sum of signal amplitudes in the\nV0A and V0C scintillators, covering the pseudorapidity regions 2.8 < |η| < 5.1 and\n−3.7 < |η| < −1.7, respectively. As mentioned in Sec. 7.2, in the scenario described\nby PYTHIA 8 with CR-BLC, the low-pT Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 excess is bound to the underlying-event\n\nactivity, which is well represented by NMPI in the model. While in this case the very same\ndependence on NMPI can be observed similarly to the case of the Nch and Nfw classes,\nclassification based on observables linked toNMPI can better differentiate between specific\nscenarios [125].\n\n112\n\n\n\nChapter 7 – Enhanced Production of Charmed Baryons\n\nBesides Λ+\nc baryons originating directly from the hadronization, there is a significant\n\ncontribution from decay products of other charmed hadrons (predominantly the Σ0,++\nc\n\nstates), that even exceeds direct production at low pT [111]. These two charm baryonic\nstates differ in their isospin, which may influence the production of these particles depend-\ning on the hadronization mechanism. Both contributions are ordered with event activity.\nHowever, secondary Λ+\n\nc production from Σ0,++\nc decays dominates the low-pT range and\n\ndiminishes toward higher pT, the contribution of direct Λ+\nc is relatively flat in pT, and thus\n\ndominates the high-pT range.

Most notable in the figure is that there\nis no significant NMPI ordering, indicating that the event-activity-dependent production\nis predominantly connected to the charm content and it is not affected by strangeness\ncontent. The slight dependence on pT can be the consequence of the different masses\nand an overall relative suppression of strangeness production at low pT. It is also to be\nnoted that the NMPI-dependent enhancement in the strange baryon-to-meson ratio Λ0/K0\n\nS\n\nis predicted by PYTHIA 8 alone, albeit to a smaller extent compared to PYTHIA with CR-\nBLC. In Fig. 7.7 (right panel) I show the double-strange-to-non-strange charmed baryon\nratio Ω0\n\nc/Λ\n+\nc as a function of pT for several NMPI classes. While for smaller pT values the\n\ntrend looks similar to that observed for the Ξ0,+\nc /Λ+\n\nc , at higher pT values there is a clear\nseparation between the MPI classes despite the statistical fluctuations. Further studies\nare needed to decide whether the observed trend can be attributed to the difference in the\nstrange content between Ξ0,+\n\nc and Ω0\nc .\n\nIn the following I investigate some distinctive experimental signatures of the enhance-\nment of different charm baryons recapitulated above. To focus on the differences caused\nby the isospin and strangeness content, we can look at the baryon-to-baryon ratios. Fol-\nlowing the method outlined in Sec.7.2 I take the integral of the ratios in the semi-soft\n(coalescence) regime 2 < pT < 8 GeV/c. To characterize the UE and the jettiness of an\nevent, I use a single variable, spherocity, in minimum-bias data, as well as the RNC and\nRT variables in events where a high-momentum trigger hadron is present.\n\nIn Fig. 7.8 I show the Σ0,++\nc /Λ+\n\nc (left), Ξ0,+\nc /Λ+\n\nc (center) and Ω0\nc/Λ\n\n+\nc (right) ratios\n\nintegrated over the coalescence regime, in fixedNch ranges, for different S0 classes.

In case of the strange to non-strange charmed baryon ratios, no\ndependence is observed in either case.\n\n7.4 Summary\nRecent observations of low-pT enhancement of charmed-baryon production relative to\ncharmed mesons in proton–proton collisions at LHC energies question the universality\nof charm fragmentation and provide a challenge for our present theoretical models.\n\nIn this chapter I demonstrated that appropriately defined event-activity classifiers pro-\nvide great sensitivity to the charm production mechanisms of the Λ+\n\nc baryons in proton–\nproton collisions at LHC energies. Utilizing PYTHIA 8 simulations with color-reconnection\nbeyond leading color approximation, I found that the Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 yield ratio in hadron-triggered\n\nevents shows a pronounced dependence on the transverse-event-activity classifier RT, but\nshows no significant dependence on the RNC transverse-event-activity classifier which re-\nflects event activity related to the leading hard process. Considering that in PYTHIA 8, RT\n\nis correlated with the number of MPIs of an event, and that by construction RNC reflects\n\n116\n\n\n\nChapter 7 – Enhanced Production of Charmed Baryons\n\nthe event activity related to the leading hard process, this provides the means to distinguish\nbetween these two sources.\n\nI also showed that the Λ+\nc /D\n\n0 yield ratio depends on the transverse spherocity S0 in\nevents with sufficiently high final-state multiplicity. Since collision events characterized\nby low values of transverse spherocity S0 are more jet-like and events with high S0 in\nthe same multiplicity class are more isotropic, this variable has sensitivity to whether the\nexcess Λ+\n\nc production is linked to the underlying event or linked to the jet processes.\nI found that the usage of flattenicity, a new quantity to represent multiple-parton in-\n\nteractions, is even more distinctive and helps pin down which type of events the enhance-\nment stems from. These observations therefore show that in the scenario implemented\nby PYTHIA 8 with CR-BLC Mode 2 the excess Λ+\n\nc production is primarily linked to the\nunderlying event activity and not to the jet production.\n\nHere I also note that simulations of the low-pT charmed-baryon enhancement as a func-\ntion of event multiplicity in the central and the forward pseudorapidity regions show very\nsimilar trends. Since the multiplicity at forward pseudorapidity is much less connected to\njet production than that in the central range due to the gap in the phase space between the\ntwo regions, this also suggests that in the CR-BLC scenario the Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 enhancement is\n\ndriven by mechanisms other than charm-production in the jets.\nIn the model class considering CR-BLC, Λ+\n\nc is sensitive to the underlying-event ac-\ntivity. While this sensitivity is present both in directly produced as well as decay Λ+\n\nc\n\nbaryons, the excess is dominated by the decay contribution at low pT (. 8 GeV/c), and\nby the direct production at higher pT (& 16 GeV/c) values. This is not a consequence of\ndecay kinematics. The comparison of Σ0,++\n\nc and Λ+\nc enhancement suggests that isospin-\n\ndependent effects are present and they are linked to the formation of charm baryons via\ncolor junctions. While strangeness enhancement itself is reproduced by models without\ncolor junctions, the enhanced production of charm baryons (either with strange or non-\nstrange content) requires color reconnection beyond leading order. In both the strange and\nnon-strange cases, charm baryon enhancement comes from the underlying event and not\nfrom the jet region. While the isospin-dependent effects seem to be linked to the forma-\ntion of charm baryons via color junctions, results on the Ξ0,+\n\nc implies that strangeness does\nnot play a strong role in the enhancement of charmed baryons, although the case of the\ndouble-strange Ω0\n\nc needs further investigation.\nThe ongoing Run 3 data taking period at the LHC and beyond will allow for differen-\n\ntial measurements of charmed-hadron production with an unprecedented precision. The\ncomparison of Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 ratios in hadron-triggered data as a function ofRT andRNC, as well\n\nas the double-differential evaluation of minimum-bias data as a function of S0 and Nch,\nand as a function of ρ andNch, opens up the possibility to differentiate between competing\nscenarios that describe flavor-dependent hadron production in the underlying event and\nwithin jets. The LHC Run 3 data taking period will also allow to differentiate between\nmechanisms of strangeness and charm enhancement.\n\n117\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nSummary\n\nThe research presented in this thesis primarily focuses on the exploration of the boundary\nbetween hard and soft processes that occur in proton–proton collisions using light- and\nheavy flavor production. This is a relatively unexplored area despite its significance. One\nof the specific aims was to study jet fragmentation and hadronization properties in high-\nenergy proton–proton collisions to shed light on the particle production mechanisms that\nlead to collective-like behavior in small systems, and may help provide a better explanation\nof observed collective phenomena in high-multiplicity proton–proton collisions, that do\nnot include the quark-gluon plasma. In this chapter I summarize the main results and\nconclusions, while also providing an outlook on future research.\n\nOne of the main areas of my investigations was the study of jets. I measured differ-\nential and integral jet shapes in simulations and found modifications caused by non-trivial\nquantum chromodynamics effects, including a clear multiplicity (number of charged final\nstate particles) dependence, which could be experimentally measured with the methods\nproposed in this thesis. Based on simulations with different MC event generators, I in-\ntroduced a characteristic jet size observable rch that depends only on the pjet\n\nT but is inde-\npendent of the jet reconstruction algorithms, parton density functions, and even the choice\nof simulation parameters such as color reconnection and multiple-parton interactions. Its\npT-dependence qualitatively follows a Lorentz-boost curve. In a novel jet shape analy-\nsis, I introduced a double ratio of the differential jet shapes to measure the multiplicity\ndependence with minimizing biases. These observations suggest that rch is an inherent\nproperty of jets that is characteristic to the spatial development of the parton shower at a\ngiven momentum.\n\nI compared the multiplicity dependence of jet structure variables for multiple popular\nPYTHIA 8 tunes and also for different MPI and CR models in several pT bins. I found that\nthe evolution of the differential jet structure ρ(r) with multiplicity significantly differs in\nseveral pjet\n\nT ranges for the Monash, MonashStar, and 4C tunes. The shape of the difference\nis nontrivial in pjet\n\nT , but persistent through all tested choices of multiplicity selections.\n\n118\n\n\n\nChapter 8 – Summary\n\nWith this I demonstrated that the multiplicity-dependent analysis of jet momentum\nprofiles can differentiate among otherwise well-established models. This lack of under-\nstanding may have grave consequences on studies based on classification by jet properties.\nMy observations highlight the need of extending multiplicity-dependent jet structure mea-\nsurements to higher pjet\n\nT regimes.\nMy studies of the integrated jet structure variable Ψ shows a rather different Nch de-\n\npendence when MPI are turned off. This attests to the important role of multiple-parton\ninteractions in higher multiplicity events and the need for their detailed understanding in\norder to develop accurate models in jet physics. The results serve as motivation for future\nexperimental measurements.\n\nMy investigations also included the multiplicity distributions as a function of the jet\ntransverse momenta. Recent results show that the multiplicity distributions follow a scal-\ning similar to the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling, which provides important lessons\non jet fragmentation. I presented results on the scaling properties of heavy-flavor jets\nfrom different production processes, and compared them to those on inclusive jets. I used\nPYTHIA 8 simulations to evaluate the charged-hadron event multiplicities at central pseu-\ndorapidity, as a function of the charged-particle jet transverse momentum within a wide jet\ntransverse momentum range. I found that the multiplicity distributions satisfy a KNO-like\nscaling with pjet\n\nT for both charm and beauty jets similarly to what has been observed for\ninclusive jets. I also found that the multiplicity distributions in events with jets initiated\nby charm and beauty directly from the leading hard process show some departure from the\nnegative binomial shape, depending on the pjet\n\nT .\nFurther analysis of the statistical moments of the multiplicity distributions shows that\n\nthe scaling is fulfilled within ≈5% throughout the full pjet\nT range, but the deviations are\n\nmore significant for leading-order heavy flavor creation, especially in the case of beauty.\nOn the other hand, beauty production from the parton shower tends to deviate less from\nscaling expectations and follows the inclusive-jet trend within uncertainties. We conclude\ntherefore that the KNO-like scaling originates from the parton level of the early stages of\nthe collision, and not from the later stages of parton shower or jet fragmentation.\n\nA good description of hadron multiplicity distributions is a basic requirement for mod-\nels and it is generally fulfilled by the most widely used event generators. However, multi-\nplicities as a function of the jet momentum for jets tagged with different flavors can provide\nmeans to further validate heavy-flavor production and fragmentation models. Also, while\nevent multiplicity is a good proxy for jet multiplicity in case of jets coming from the lead-\ning hard process, this is not necessarily the case for jets that come from secondary hard\nprocesses or gluon radiation. An interesting extension of the current work in this direction\ncould therefore be to evaluate the scaling in terms of the jet multiplicity instead of event\nmultiplicity, and to see whether in that case the scaling of heavy flavor jets from the parton\nshower follows light or heavy jets.\n\n119\n\n\n\nChapter 8 – Summary\n\nThe search for the KNO-like scaling in simulations for heavy-flavor jets served as a\nmotivation to carry out the first measurement of jet-momentum-dependent jet multiplicity\ndistributions with the ALICE experiment and measure the KNO-like scaling. The jet mul-\ntiplicity distributions can be all collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, however calculat-\ning the first nine moments of the distributions, I found an approximately 20% discrepancy\ntoward higher statistical momenta, which is not very significant considering the statistical\nerrors. This may indicate that the KNO-like scaling was seen in simulations only because\nof the specific multiplicity distributions of the particular applied model. It is to be noted\nhowever, that the current data is not completely corrected: the background subtraction is\nyet to be implemented. This may influence the observed multiplicity distributions.\n\nIn high-energy hadron collisions, heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mainly pro-\nduced in hard parton scattering processes. Two-particle angular correlations originating\nfrom heavy-flavor particles allow for the characterization of parton shower and fragmenta-\ntion. The ALICE collaboration measured the heavy-flavor electron-hadron azimuthal cor-\nrelation distributions between heavy-flavor decay electrons and associated charged parti-\ncles in proton–proton and p–Pb collisions at\n\n√\ns = 5.02 TeV. I created detailed simulations\n\nto compare the near- and away-side peaks of the azimuthal-correlation distribution in pp\n\nand p–Pb collisions to the model predictions. This allowed verifying the implementation\nof the processes of charm- and beauty-quark production, fragmentation, and hadroniza-\ntion, which have an impact on the observables studied in this analysis. The correlation\nstructures are fitted with a constant and two von Mises functions to obtain the baseline\nand the near- and away-side peaks, respectively. The evolution of the near- and away-side\npeaks of the correlation functions in pp and p–Pb collisions was found to be similar in all\nthe considered kinematic ranges. This suggests that the modification of the fragmentation\nand hadronization of heavy quarks due to cold-nuclear-matter effects is indistinguishable\nwithin the current precision of the measurements.\n\nAnother major topic in my thesis, connected to jet fragmentation, concerns the un-\nderstanding of heavy-flavor hadroproduction in proton–proton collisions at LHC energies.\nThe production cross section of hadrons can be calculated using the factorization theorem,\nwhich usually assumes that the fragmentation functions are universal across different colli-\nsion systems. Recent observations of low-pT enhancement of charmed-baryon production\nrelative to charmed mesons in proton–proton collisions at LHC energies questioned the\nuniversality of charm fragmentation and provide a challenge for our present theoretical\nmodels.\n\nI used a model with color reconnection beyond leading color (CR-BLC) approxima-\ntion to seek explanation for the charm-baryon enhancement, and proposed new observables\nfor future measurements. I characterized the collision events using different event-activity\nclassifiers, that allow for investigating the connections between the leading QCD processes\nand the underlying event. I demonstrated that appropriately defined event-activity classi-\nfiers provide great sensitivity to the charm production mechanisms of the Λ+\n\nc baryons.\n\n120\n\n\n\nChapter 8 – Summary\n\nUtilizing PYTHIA 8 simulations with enhanced color-reconnection I found that the\nΛ+\n\nc /D\n0 yield ratio in hadron-triggered events shows a pronounced dependence on the\n\ntransverse-event-activity classifier RT, but shows no significant dependence on the RNC\n\nclassifier which reflects event activity related to the leading hard process. Considering that\nin PYTHIA 8, RT is correlated with the number of MPI of an event, and that by construc-\ntion RNC reflects the event activity related to the leading hard process, this provides the\nmeans to distinguish between these two sources.\n\nI also showed that the Λ+\nc /D\n\n0 yield ratio significantly depends on the transverse sphe-\nrocity S0 in events with sufficiently high final-state multiplicity. Since collision events\ncharacterized by low values of transverse spherocity S0 are more jet-like and events with\nhigh S0 in the same multiplicity class are more isotropic, this variable has sensitivity to\nwhether the excess Λ+\n\nc production is linked to the underlying event or linked to the jet\nprocesses.\n\nI found that the usage of flattenicity, a new quantity to represent multiple-parton in-\nteractions, is even more distinctive and helps pin down which type of events the enhance-\nment stems from. These observations therefore show, that in the scenario implemented\nby PYTHIA 8 with enhanced color reconnection Mode 2, the excess Λ+\n\nc production is\nprimarily linked to the underlying event activity and not to the jet production.\n\nThe comparison of Σ0,++\nc and Λ+\n\nc enhancement suggests that isospin-dependent effects\nare present and they are linked to the formation of charm baryons via color junctions.\nWhile strangeness enhancement itself is reproduced by models without color junctions,\nthe enhanced production of charm baryons (either with strange or non-strange content)\nrequires color reconnection beyond leading order. In both the strange and non-strange\ncases, charm baryon enhancement comes from the underlying event and not from the jet\nregion.\n\nWhile the isospin-dependent effects seem to be linked to the formation of charm\nbaryons via color junctions, results on the Ξ0,+\n\nc implies that strangeness does not play\na strong role in the enhancement of charmed baryons, although the case of the double-\nstrange Ω0\n\nc needs further investigation.\nThe ongoing Run 3 data taking period at the LHC and beyond will allow for differen-\n\ntial measurements of charmed-hadron production with an unprecedented precision. The\ncomparison of Λ+\n\nc /D\n0 ratios in hadron-triggered data as a function ofRT andRNC, as well\n\nas the double-differential evaluation of minimum-bias data as a function of S0 and Nch,\nand as a function of ρ andNch, opens up the possibility to differentiate between competing\nscenarios that describe flavor-dependent hadron production in the underlying event and\nwithin jets. The LHC Run 3 data taking period will also allow to differentiate between\nmechanisms of strangeness and charm enhancement.\n\n121\n\n\n\nThesis Statements\n\nThis thesis presents my research on the fragmentation properties of light and heavy-flavor\nhadrons, covering jet shapes, multiplicity distribution scaling, azimuthal correlations of\nheavy-flavor decay electrons and hadrons, and charmed baryon production as a function\nof the event activity. In the following thesis statements I summarize my novel contributions\nto each of these subjects.\n\n1. Multiplicity-dependent Jet Structure and Fragmentation\n\nI analyzed the differential and integral jet shapes and performed an event multiplicity-\ndifferential study in proton-proton collisions created with the PYTHIA event generator. By\nutilizing a double ratio of observables to minimize the bias in the multiplicity measure-\nment, I showed that the jet shapes depend on the event multiplicity, which can be used for\nmodel differentiation in experimental data. By looking at the multiplicity dependence of\nthe jet shape distributions, I observed a characteristic jet size, which is robust against dif-\nferent parton density functions, jet reconstruction algorithms and multiplicity selections.\nIt qualitatively follows a Lorentz-boost curve, which suggests it being an inherent property\nof the jets and is characteristic to the space-time evolution of the parton shower at a given\nmomentum [187, 226, 227].\n\n2. Scaling Properties of Jet Structure in Theory and the ALICE Ex-\nperiment\n\nThe Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling hypothesis is an influential contribution to the\nanalysis of event multiplicities in high-energy particle collisions, according to which the\nevent-multiplicity distributions can be all collapsed onto a universal scaling curve. Recent\nphenomenological studies suggest that a similar scaling may hold within single jets, if we\nconsider the jet multiplicity as a function of the jet transverse momentum. I conducted an\nanalysis on the KNO-like scaling for heavy-flavor jets in pp collisions at\n\n√\ns = 13 TeV\n\nusing Monte Carlo event generators. I found that the KNO-like scaling stems from the par-\ntonic level of the interaction. Motivated by the results, I conducted the first measurement\n\n122\n\n\n\nChapter 8 – Summary\n\nof the jet multiplicity distributions as a function of jet transverse momentum in pp colli-\nsions in the ALICE experiment at\n\n√\ns = 13 TeV, which allowed to quantify the KNO-like\n\njet scaling properties and thus help further our understanding of jet fragmentation proper-\nties [193, 228].\n\n3. Azimuthal Correlations of Heavy-flavor Decay Electrons with the\nALICE Experiment\n\nIn high-energy hadron collisions, heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mainly produced\nin hard parton scattering processes. Two-particle angular correlations originating from\nheavy-flavor particles allow for the characterization of parton shower and fragmentation.\nThe ALICE collaboration measured the heavy-flavor electron-hadron azimuthal correla-\ntion distributions between heavy-flavor decay electrons and associated charged particles\nin pp and p–Pb collisions at\n\n√\ns = 5.02 TeV. My main contribution to the analysis was\n\nto create detailed simulations to compare the near- and away-side peaks of the azimuthal-\ncorrelation distribution in pp and p–Pb collisions to the model predictions. This allowed\nverifying the model implementation of the processes of charm- and beauty-quark produc-\ntion, fragmentation, and hadronization, which have an impact on the observables stud-\nied in this analysis. I also determined the correlation peak shape using FONLL pQCD\ncalculations for the modelling of charm and beauty contributions. The correlation struc-\ntures are fitted with a constant and two von Mises functions to obtain the baseline and\nthe near- and away-side peaks, respectively. The evolution of the near- and away-side\npeaks of the correlation functions in pp and p–Pb collisions was found to be similar in all\nthe considered kinematic ranges. This suggests that the modification of the fragmentation\nand hadronization of heavy quarks due to cold-nuclear-matter effects is indistinguishable\nwithin the current precision of the measurements [108].\n\n4. Charm-baryon Enhancement and the Role of the Underlying Event\n\nPerturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations have been successful in de-\nscribing the production of heavy-flavor mesons for several collision energies at the LHC.\nThe usual description relies on the factorization approach, in which the production cross\nsection of heavy-flavor hadrons in the hadronic collisions is calculated as a convolution\nof the parton density functions (PDFs) of the colliding hadrons, the cross section of the\nhard-scattering process and the heavy-quark fragmentation function. However, recent ex-\nperimental results from the CERN LHC show a relative enhancement of charmed baryons\ncompared to the factorization approach expectations based on electron-positron collisions.\nI utilized the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator with color reconnection beyond\nleading-color approximation and proposed experimental methods based on event-activity\nclassifiers to probe the source of the charmed-baryon enhancement. I concluded, that in\n\n123\n\n\n\nChapter 8 – Summary\n\nthe considered model class the Λ+\nc enhancement is connected to the underlying event and\n\ndoes not depend significantly on the processes inside the jet region [125, 229].\n\n5. Production of Excited Charm and Charm-strange Baryon States\n\nI extended the studies of the Λ+\nc baryon enhancement to several different charmed baryons\n\nand I also investigated the production of charmed baryons with different isospin and\nstrangeness content, then compared it to both charmed D0 mesons and to Λ+\n\nc baryons\nin pp collisions at LHC energies. I showed that the isospin of the charmed-baryon state\nhas a strong impact on the enhancement pattern. Using the observables I propose, upcom-\ning high-precision experimental data will be able to differentiate between mechanisms of\nstrangeness and charm enhancement [230, 231].\n\n124\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] A.B.

This matter was dominated by quarks and gluons that are subject to the strong force. Under usual circumstances, quarks are confined into hadrons. However, at extreme temperatures and densities, quarks and gluons can enter a deconfined state, forming the so-called quark-gluon plasma (QGP). To recreate the extreme conditions of matter which existed in the very early universe, we use powerful accelerators to make collisions between protons or heavy-ions, such as gold or lead nuclei. In the heavy-ion collisions hundreds of protons and neutrons in two such nuclei collide into each other to form a minuscule fireball in which everything melts into the quark-gluon plasma. The fireball then starts cooling and the individual quarks and gluons (collectively called partons) recombine into ordinary matter that flies away in all directions until they end up in our detectors. The final state of the collision contains many species of particles such as pions and kaons, which are mesons consisting of a quark-antiquark pair; or protons and neutrons, which are baryons containing three quarks; and even antiprotons and antineutrons, which may combine to form the nuclei of antiatoms as heavy as helium."

The experimental discovery of the Higgs boson, which was for decades just a prediction, decreed the completion of the Standard Model (SM). This gauge theory is the current framework to describe elementary particles and their interactions. Its predictions have been verified with great precision, but many questions remain unsolved. Why is electroweak symmetry broken and what sets the scale? Is it broken by the SM Higgs or by a richer Higgs sector? Is the Higgs an elementary or a composite particle? What is dark matter made of? What is the origin of the asymmetry between baryons and anti-baryons in the Universe? These are only a few hints that the SM is not the end of the story and there is physics beyond to explore. In order to try to answer these questions, new theories have been proposed such as supersymmetry (SUSY). This is a generalization of the space-time symmetry of a quantum field theory that associates a fermion to each SM boson and the other way around. It also foresees the existence of a particle, the lightest neutralino, which is one of the most promising candidates for dark matter (DM). DM is the most fascinating evidence of physics beyond SM. The existence of DM is in fact confirmed by astrophysical observations but its nature is still a mystery. Collections of new particles, called hidden sectors, have been proposed to solve this issue. They are not directly charged under SM strong, weak and electromagnetic forces, and interact with ordinary matter through a mediator. According to the mediator’s spin and parity, different portals between SM and DM can be distinguished. The dark-SUSY is a vector-portal hidden sector that adds to the minimal SUSY model the gauge symmetry group U(1)D that spontaneously breaks giving rise to a light dark photon. A possible strategy to search for DM exploits the potential of colliders. The latest achievements confirm that these machines are at the forefront of scientific discoveries in high-energy physics. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of the experiments hosted along the ring of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Together with ATLAS, it announced the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 and is still working incessantly to collect data and shed light both on the SM and new physics. In addition to existing apparatus, new colliders are proposed to deepen our understanding of the SM open questions and to tackle novel challenges that might emerge from future discoveries at the LHC. Among these, the Muon Collider would combine the high precision of electron-positron colliders and the high center-of-mass energy and luminosities of hadron machines leading to an unprecedented discovery potential. In this context, we examine an extension of the dark-SUSY model with a dark Higgs boson, originating from a neutralino, decaying into two dark photons that then decay into pairs of muons. In total, starting from neutralino pair production, eight muons are present in the final state. The thesis deals with the search for this hidden sector in the CMS experiment (Part I) and also furnishes preliminary predictions for a future Muon Collider (Part II). The work is organised as follows. After a brief introduction about the SM, Chapter 1 presents an overview of the physics beyond the SM, focusing in particular on supersymmetry, dark matter and hidden sectors. Chapter 2 shows the work done from a theoretical point of view to implement the extension of the model to be used in event generators. Concerning the CMS experiment, Chapter 3 describes the LHC machine with design and operational parameters and the CMS detector with information about physics object reconstruction. Chapter 4 reports the search including signal sample generation, background estimation, analysis strategy for event selection, discussion of systematic uncertainties and statistical interpretation of the limits found on the cross section. For the Muon Collider, on the other hand, Chapter 5 introduces the physics case and the machine and detector design. The last section is dedicated to studies performed on the muon system. The contribution of the beam-induced background (BIB), i.e. the collection of particles originating from the interaction of electrons and positrons from muon decay with the machine, in this region is examined and different technologies to be implemented are discussed. Finally, Chapter 6 presents the preliminary predictions obtained on the signal yield and the algorithms tested and developed for muon reconstruction with and without the BIB."

The measurement makes use of data samples collected by the LHCb experiment between the years 2011 and 2018, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 9 fb−1 pp collision data. This analysis performs an unbinned fit using a model that considers the differential branching fractions of the B0 → K∗0μ+μ− decay, which can be written in the basis of the K∗0 transversity amplitudes, with acceptance effects and background taken into account. The transversity amplitudes are measured as functions of dimuon invariant mass squared, q2, and are modelled with Legendre polynomial ansatzes aiming to remove model dependencies as much as possible from the description of experimental datasets. These amplitudes contain P-wave amplitudes, while the S-wave amplitudes of the Kπ system are also accounted for.This analysis is performed in two q2 regions, 1.25 < q2 < 8.0 GeV2/c4 and 11.0 < q2 < 12.5 GeV2/c4. In both regions, the likelihood surfaces of individual parameters are carefully examined. The results in the 1.25 < q2 < 8.0 GeV2/c4 region present correct statistical coverage while the results from the 11.0 < q2 < 12.5 GeV2/c4 region still need further investigation. The best-fit points of the P-wave amplitudes with uncertainties and correlations will be provided as the final result of this analysis, such that synthetic datasets with the acceptance effects and background subtracted can be generated. Theorists can then use any model to fit the synthetic data to determine the vector current (C9) and axial-vector current (C10) Wilson coefficients. The theoretical models chosen can potentially provide an explanation for the anomalies seen in b → sℓ+ℓ− transitions.",
