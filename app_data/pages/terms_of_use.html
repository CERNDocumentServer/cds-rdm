<p>Use of the CERN Document Server service (hereafter “CDS”) denotes agreement with the following terms of use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        CDS is provided free of charge. It serves as a comprehensive institutional repository and dissemination
        platform for the research and historical output produced by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research,
        and its members of personnel. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.17181/dd19c-hwf65">Content Policy</a> for more details.
    </li>
    <li>
        By uploading content to CDS, the content provider affirms that such content complies with all
        applicable laws, licence conditions and third party rights, and shall hold CERN free and harmless from any related liability.
    </li>
    <li>
        All content is provided “as is” and without warranty of any kind. The user shall hold CERN and individual content
        providers free and harmless from any related liability in connection with its use of such content.
    </li>
    <li>
        Users shall respect copyright and all applicable licence conditions. The download and use of content from CDS does
        not amount to a transfer of intellectual property.
    </li>
    <li>
        CERN reserves the right, without notice or liability, and at its sole discretion, to restrict or remove a user's access
        or remove any uploaded content, where it considers that use of CDS interferes with its operations or violates these
        Terms and Conditions, and/or applicable laws.
    </li>
    <li>
        CERN bases CDS on leading technologies and architectures, operated within the limits of its financial and human
        resources and made available by CERN on an "as is” and "best efforts” basis. Access to, availability and use of
        CDS is not guaranteed nor can be expected.
    </li>
    <li>
        CERN excludes and disclaims all liability for damage resulting from users’ access, or inability to access, or use of CDS.
    </li>
    <li>
        These terms and conditions of use are subject to change by CERN at any time and without notice, other than through posting
        the updated terms on the CDS website. Any revised terms and conditions of use shall become effective immediately upon posting.
    </li>
</ul>
