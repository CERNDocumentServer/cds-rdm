<h2>Scope and Purpose</h2>
<p>
    The CERN Document Server (CDS) serves as a comprehensive institutional repository and dissemination platform for
    the research and historical output produced by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and CERN Experiments.
    Below is an overview of its scope and purpose.
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>CDS preserves various digital objects that can be categorised as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Scientific and Technical Content:</b> CDS covers a wide range of scientific and technical documents,
      including research articles, conference papers, preprints, reports, slides, talks, theses, as well
      as other research outputs like software, data, and more.
    </li>
    <li><b>Administrative Documents:</b> In addition to scientific and technical literature, CDS archives administrative
      documents crucial for CERN's governance and operations. This includes policy statements, meeting minutes, human resources
      materials, financial reports, and legal documents, providing transparency and accountability in CERN's management and
      decision-making processes.
    </li>
    <li><b>Multidisciplinary Content:</b> While CERN is primarily focused on particle physics, CDS also includes content
        from related disciplines such as accelerator physics, engineering, computing, etc.
    </li>
    <li><b>Historical Archive:</b> CDS contains historical documents and archival material related to the history of CERN,
        including early research papers, technical reports, and institutional records.
    </li>
    <li><b>Multimedia Content:</b> CDS also hosts a variety of multimedia content related to scientific research,
        educational outreach, and institutional events. This includes videos, presentations, images, audio recordings,
        and interactive media, enriching the repository with diverse resources for knowledge dissemination, education,
        and public engagement with particle physics and related fields.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Institutional Repository:</b> CDS serves as a centralised platform for managing and preserving the scientific
        output of CERN and its collaborators. It facilitates the discovery, access, and dissemination of research findings to
        the global scientific community.
    </li>
    <li><b>Open Access:</b> CDS promotes open access to scientific information by providing free and unrestricted access
        to its collection of documents whenever possible. This helps to maximise the impact and visibility of CERN's research output.
    </li>
    <li><b>Collaboration and Communication:</b> CDS fosters collaboration and communication among researchers by providing
        tools for sharing, discussing, and collaborating on scientific documents.
    </li>
    <li><b>Archiving and Preservation:</b> CDS plays a crucial role in archiving and preserving the intellectual
        heritage of CERN. It ensures the long-term accessibility and integrity of scientific and technical literature
        produced by the organisation.
    </li>
    <li><b>Compliance and Reporting:</b> CDS helps CERN comply with institutional and funding agency policies
        regarding research dissemination and reporting.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Overall, CDS serves as a vital resource for researchers, students, educators, and the general public interested in
    accessing and exploring the scientific achievements and advancements made at CERN over the years. It embodies CERN's
    commitment to excellence in research, collaboration, and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17181/CERN.RTIF.Z8BO">open science</a>.
</p>

<h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Eligibility:</b> Only CERN personnel and collaborators are permitted to submit content to the CDS.
        Submissions from external parties are not accepted. Furthermore, regarding scientific outputs,
        <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1202777/files/CERN_Circ_Op_en_06.pdf">Operational Circular N.6</a> applies.
    </li>
    <li><b>Content Criteria:</b> All content submitted to CDS must be institutional in nature and of legitimate
        interest to the organisation (therefore, personal content is not permitted). Submissions should be materials
        worth preserving for the long term, including scientific and technical literature, administrative documents,
        multimedia content, and other materials relevant to CERN's mission and activities.
    </li>
    <li><b>Quality Assurance:</b> Submissions may undergo review by relevant communities to ensure compliance with
        CDS guidelines and relevance to CERN's objectives. Content deemed inappropriate or not meeting the criteria may be rejected.
    </li>
    <li><b>Metadata Requirements:</b> In order to increase discoverability of content, submitters are required
        to provide accurate and complete metadata for each submission, including title, author(s), abstract, keywords,
        and relevant classification information.
    </li>
    <li><b>Copyright and Licensing:</b> Submitters must ensure and warrant to CERN that they have all necessary
        rights (including any required individual consents) to submit the uploaded content to CDS for open dissemination
        and that they specify any copyright or licensing restrictions associated with such content. Use of CDS multimedia
        content, is subject to the following terms of use: <a href="https://copyright.web.cern.ch/">https://copyright.web.cern.ch/</a>

    Users cannot delete content by themselves, reflecting our commitment to the enduring preservation of institutional knowledge.
</p>

<h3>Grace Period for Content Deletion</h3>
<p>
    Upon submission, content enters a grace period of one month during which it can be deleted upon request. If you need
    to remove a submission within this period, please contact the CDS support line. Our team will assist you in processing
    the deletion request promptly. This grace period allows for corrections and reconsiderations while ensuring that the
    repository maintains accurate and reliable records.
</p>

<h3>Post-Grace Period Removal</h3>
<p>
    Once the grace period has elapsed, the ability to delete content is significantly restricted to uphold the integrity
    and completeness of the repository. Content will only be removed by the CDS support team under specific circumstances, namely:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Breach of Terms:</b> If the content violates this policy, including the CDS Terms and Conditions,
        it may be subject to removal at any time without notice. This includes issues related to where the content
        was submitted without proper authorization or infringes on the intellectual property rights (i.e. copyright, etc.) of others.
    </li>
    <li><b>Data Privacy Concerns (OC11):</b> In compliance with Operational Circular No. 11, which governs data privacy
        at CERN, content that compromises personal data or violates privacy regulations will be considered for removal.
    </li>
    <li><b>Restricted Content:</b> Content that has been marked as restricted and that has never been authorised
        to be made public may be eligible for deletion upon valid request and evaluation.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure for Removal Requests</h3>
<p>
    For content removal requests beyond the grace period, please submit a
    <a href="https://cern.service-now.com/service-portal?id=service_element&name=CDS-Service">support request</a> providing a
    detailed explanation of the reason for the request, including any supporting documentation if applicable (e.g., evidence
    of copyright infringement or privacy concerns). Each request will be carefully reviewed by the CDS administration team to ensure
    compliance with our policies and legal obligations.
</p>

<h3>Commitment to Long-Term Preservation</h3>
<p>
    Our primary goal is to maintain a comprehensive and enduring repository that supports CERN's mission of advancing scientific
    knowledge and preserving its institutional heritage. To this end, the content in CDS will be preserved for the lifetime
    of the laboratory. By adhering to these withdrawal and removal policies, we aim to balance the need for flexibility with
    the imperative of long-term and accurate content preservation.
