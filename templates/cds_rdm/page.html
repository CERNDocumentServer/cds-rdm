  {# 
    TEMPORARY FIX: The js code that stores the overridden components has 
    to be executed in the head html tag to ensure that the js bundles loaded
    with various macros are loaded after the "overridable-registry" bundle.
    
    This should be REMOVED once the issue is fixed on the macros.
